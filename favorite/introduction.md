**Has this sort of thing ever happened to you?**

**Let's say**                                                       <!-- 現在(進行)形でもいいみたい -->
you are a freelance web developer.
and you are walking down the street with your computer of course.
and you are coding on your client's code base of course.

**but then**
you trip on a branch.
and not a git branch.
**I mean** a real life branch.

Your computer flies out of you hands.                               <!-- 接続詞はなくていいんだね -->
It falls on the ground, smashes into a million pieces
and you're screwed.

**Now**                                                             <!-- 接続詞はなくていいんだね -->
you have to go get a new laptop.
you have to add all
your dot files,
your configurations,
your libraries,
the Frameworks,
the packages,
everything.
and get re-setup with your client codebase.
You just lost **hours maybe even days** of setup time.

**But what if I told you**
you weren't screwed.
and **there's a better way** with a program called coder.

You can self-host containerized applications and environments in your machine
**so** you can spin up new work spaces like no problem whatsoever.

Seriously check this out.
