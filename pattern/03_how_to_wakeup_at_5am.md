> [なうゎゅra]
> Okay,
> Now I want you to stop trying to become a morning person,
>  because nobody wants to become a morning person.

> For a lot of us, meantime happens before the rest of the world wakes up.
>   It's `just kind of` difficult when you want to be one of those people who hasn't woken up yet.

> The struggle is real, right?
>  It's like do you wake up early, and `go after` the life you want with all the time that you get back
>   or do you sleep like a little baby
>   because you're still so good at it
>   and you are like "why waste all the good sleep. I feel like I should just stay here."
