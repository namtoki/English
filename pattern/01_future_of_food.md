Uma
> I'm an optimist.
>
> And
> [  挿入 ]  [                          M (in order for 人 to V)                       ]
> I think, in order for us to be able to solve these immense challenges ahead of us,
> it's going to require
>   the worldview of optimism, but a very pragmatic view of solutions.
>   and
>   `going at it` over and over again.
> 
> Because
> what might not have worked                                                        `what V で「V なもの」`
> (a month ago or a week or even a year ago or a decade ago,)
> would work now.                                                                   `what not V なものが、今は V するようになるだろう`

Jonkung
> A focus on the optimism is, (I think,) what we need for (like) younger generation `無生物主語` `I think の挿入` `繋ぎ言葉 like`
> and
> I do think, your work is one of those examples of good things.

Uma
> The connection with food itself, it always goes back to childhood for me.         `名詞, it V`
>
> And
> I grew up in the kitchen, (so to speak,) with my mom,
> trying to cook everything she did.                                                `その理由を述べたいので分詞構文`
>
> I used to watch her, tried to help her chop vegetables,
>                            or go to the Sunday market with my dad and bring back meat and slice meat,
> and
> (kind of) wanted to cook from day one.                                            `and の後で並列の主語を省略`
> 
> but
> I realized some of my skills weren't great.
> 
> So
> I went to school in India,
>
> And
> there was this `hawker` who was right outside our school
>
> And
> I was fascinated with his work
> because
> he used to sell the fast foods of India called dhaji (and things like that)       `とかとか`
>
> But
> the way he chopped onions, (just,) I was `hooked onto it`.                          `名詞, I V it` `もうほんとに just`
> because
> he would slice them up,
> (like,) he'll take an onion, and in 10 seconds, the whole thing will be sliced and diced like, finely.
> I'm like, I'm going to master that.
>
> So
> I became the master slicer-dicer of onions in my house.
>
> And
> (later on in food,) (obviously,) (look,)                                          `ほら、ねぇ look`
> it's the most creative expression of anything you can do in a daily life.
>
> And
> I love to cook with my wife and kids,
> and
> it's just became part of my life.
>
> And
> I feel like it's also a way to fiercely express your creativity or independence and what you want that creation to be.
>
> So yeah,
> it's just deeply, deeply connected to food.
>
> What about yours?
> What's your personal connection to food?

Jonkung
> My personal connection to food, (as you said,) it is an expression of my creativity,  `名詞, M, it V`
> but
> it is also a way that we express our culture
>            and
>            a way that we `pass down` our culture.
>
> So
> (growing up in Hong Kong as well as Toronto,)
> food was very much a way that I `was attached to` the things that my parents loved as well as my grandparents.
>
> Um,
> My own `grasp on` Cantonese language is very, very, weak.
> (because of all the traveling that we did when I was younger
>
> So
> I felt like relearning cultural dishes was a way that I would easily `get in contact with` my roots.
> (`without having to` learn a language)

Uma
> What did food mean to you when you were growing up in Hong Kong?

Jonkung
> (I mean,) (food,) I was very, very blessed.                                       `ええと I mean` `名詞のみで話題を示す`
> Hong Kong, as is India, has a very rich culinary history.
>                         and
>                         actually shares a little similar ones in terms of,
>                         (I would guess)

Uma
> Is it the spices?                                                                     `Is it O?`

Jonkung
> Well, `imperialism`.
>
> Yes. Yeah but
> our appreciation for spices and flavors.
> there's an internationality that was brought into there.
>
> So
> I `was very spoiled for choice` (in terms of what good food is).
>
> and
> I used that memory to, (kind of like,) craft my entire skill set
> because
>   I'm `self-taught`,
>   and
>   I had nothing to `go off of` except my earlier experiences with food. `頼る`
>
> So (luckily, like)
> Hong Kong taught me how to eat.
>
> And (by that,)
> I taught myself how to cook.

Uma
> So
> was that experience one of those formative ones that made you say, "I want to cook in America"?

Jonkung
> Yeah
> The biggest reason was (because)  `because は文法的には不要だが、口語ではよく挿入される`
>   where I was living,
>   where I do live now,
>   Detroit,
>     (at the time)                 `S (M) V が口語で多用されることがわかる`
>     didn't have a lot of options for traditional Cantonese food that I missed.
> 
> So
> out of necessity, which,
> (as I think like,)
>   is a very common thread among a lot of students from Asia,
>   is like they teach themselves how to cook
>     because
>       where they end up for school doesn't offer the food that they miss from home.
>
> And yeah,
> that was (pretty much) the basis of it.
>
> `It just so happened that` it turned into my career `as opposed to` just a hobby.
>
> What made you want to be a cardiologist, then?

Uma
> (Look,)
> I grew up watching my grandfather, who had been taking care of patients all his life,

Jonkung
> So
> he was a doctor as well?

Uma
> He was a physician.
>
> And uh
> I loved it when he would take care of people,     `V1 it when S V2 で S が V2 するのが V1 だ`
> and
> there would be this expression of, I think, gratitude.
>
> And
> my grandfather would not expect anything in return.
> He never charged a dollar for anyone.
> He was in the Gandhian movement and freedom movement for India.
>
> And
> I just grew up adoring him.
> I'm like "Ah, that would be cool."
>
> And then
> (as I started learning more about medicine,)
> I went to one of the medical schools in India,
>   and
>   realized very quickly that cardiology is one thing `where` you would `get to` save patients' lives,
>     literally resuscitate patients who were dead in the field,
>     resuscitate them and bring them back to life.
> And
> I found nothing more gratifying than being able to save someone's life.
>
> And then
> that relationship continues afterwards,
> (because)
> then there's a bond between you and the patient
>                                     who
>                                     now is not a patient anymore,
>                                            back to living his own life or her own life.
>
> And then
> this bond with that person and their family (kind of) continues on.
>
> So
> I was really like, this is what I really want to be in my life.

Jonkung
> `Would you say (like) that`   `という感じですかね？`
>                      intersectionality of (like) being able to tend and care for people
>                      is
>                      (like,) what `crossed you over` into this food space then?

Uma
> (You know,)
> I didn't know back in 2015, 2016,
>                       when I was thinking of quitting cardiology
                                   and
                                   starting off on this crazy journey that I'm on right now,
> (but `looking back` and `reflecting on it`,)
> there is a lot of common threads
>                   (where)
>                   both are bound by a deep sense of purpose and deep sense of building relationships
>                   and
>                   `defy`ing some of the things
>                           (where)
>                           people keep telling you it's impossible to do this.
>
> It's impossible to save someone's life.
>
> They're already dead in the field.
>
> You can't `resuscitate` them back.
>
> And here,
> we are looking at a impending food crisis, climate crisis (`of such large proportions`).
>
> And
> people keep saying it's impossible to do this.
>
> We cannot do this, we will not do this, people will not change, countries won't change.
>
> And
> I think this is a much bigger fight than saving an individual patient's life.
>
> But
> I think
>   those common threads
>   of saying,
>   yes, these are possible by putting one foot in front of the other
>                              and
>                              starting to slowly `make these things go away`, `こなす`
> and
> you climb one mountain, celebrate the victory for a moment, and then the next mountain is in front of you.

Jonkung
> So
> that was your(, kind of) inspiration to start Upside?

Uma
> Yes, yeah, yeah,
> Upside Foods is a company that I started in late 2015.
>
> And
> the idea is(, you know,) the most delicious product in the world that we've known as humans is meat.

Jonkung
> Yeah, I will agree with you.

Uma
> No disrespect to salads or greens or beans,
> but
> meat is the center of plate for almost every tradition in the world.

> [         S           ] [          S<-M            ]  [          V O           ]
>
> And
> a lot of our memories
>                       growing up
>                       and
>                       also with our families now
>                                                   are tied to cooking meat.

> And
> while it's the most beloved food, there's also this incredible challenge
>                                                                          where
>                                                                          we ignore how it comes to the plate.
>
> And
> we all know there's a troubling story of how meat comes to the plate.
>
> But
> we love it so much. We love the product so much, not the process so much.
>
> And
> there hasn't been a real solution for it until now.
>
> So

> And

> So
> `we're not asking` people

> So the traditions can continue, the culture can continue.

> And

> It is really really hard to do it.

Jonkung
> `To put it to practice,`
>   What's been the biggest challenge so far

>       it's like a new way of accepting what meat is and what meat could be.
