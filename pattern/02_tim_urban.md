> So in college,
>   I was a `government major`,
>     which means
>     I had to write a lot of papers.
>
> Now,
> when a normal student writes a paper,
> they might spread the work out a little like this. `スチューンン`
>
> So you know,
>   you get started maybe a little slowly,
>   but
>   you `get enough done` in the first week,
>   `that`,
>     with some heavier days later on,  `ウィスム`
>     everything gets done, `things stay civil`.
>
> And
> I would want to do that like that.
>   That would be the plan.
>     I would have it `all ready to go`,
>     but then,
>     actually,
>     the paper would come along,
>     and then
>     I would kind of do this.
>
> And
> that would happen every single paper. `アンナット`
