> So in college,
>   __I was a [government major],__
>     which means
>     __I had to write a lot of papers.__
>
> Now, when a normal student writes a paper, __they might spread the work out__ a little like this. `スチューンン`
>
> So you know,
>   __you get started__ maybe a little slowly,
>   but
>   __you [get enough done]__ in the first week,
>   [that],
>     with some heavier days later on,  `ウィスム`
>     __everything gets done__, __[things stay civil].__
>
> And
> __I would want to do that__ like that.
>   __That would be the plan.__
>     __I would have it [all ready to go],__
>     but then,
>     actually,
>     __the paper would come along,__
>     and then
>     __I would kind of do this.__
