- 挿入
  - 挿入の I think が思ったより多い
- And の多用が思ったより多い
- 名詞を先に置いて、直後の文でそれを it で指し示す用法が多い
- It を使いこなす
  - `I loved it when S V` で、S が V するのが好きだ
  - `It is C when/if S V` という構文も便利そう

> [Because] what might not have worked a month ago or a week or even a year ago or a decade ago, would work now.

## Jonkung

👉 「those」は必ずしも必要ではないが、文の意味やニュアンスを強調したい場合に使われる
省略しても意味は通じますが、少し具体的で特定の「良い例」を指しているという印象を与えるため、「those」を使うことが一般的です。
> A focus on the optimism is, I think, what we need for like younger generation
> [and] I do think, your work is one of `those` examples of good things.

>   [and] [kind of] wanted to cook from day one,
> [but] I realized some of my skills weren't great.

👉 名詞, I V it / もうほんとに just
> [But] the way he chopped onions, [just], I was `hooked onto it`.

> [because] he would slice them up, [like], he'll take an onion,
> `and in 10 seconds`, the whole thing will be sliced and diced `like,` finely.
> I'm like, I'm going to master that.
>
> [So] I became the master slicer-dicer of onions in my house.
> [And] later on in food, obviously, [look], it's the most creative expression of anything you can do in a daily life.
>
> [And] I love to cook with my wife and kids, [and] it's just became part of my life.

>                                                         [and]
>                                                         a way that we `pass down` our cultures.

>                                              is like they teach themselves how to cook
>                      [because] where they end up for school doesn't offer the food that they miss from home.

> [And] here, we are looking at a impending food crisis, climate crisis `of such large proportions`.
> [And] people keep saying it's impossible to do this.
> We cannot do this, we will not do this, people will not change, countries won't change.

> [And] I think this is a much bigger fight than saving an individual patient's life.
> [But] I think those common threads of saying, yes,
>                                     these are possible by `putting one foot in front of the other`

> you climb one mountain, celebrate the victory for a moment, and then the next mountain is in front of you.

## Jonkung

> [So] that was your, [kind of] inspiration to start Upside?

## Uma

> Yes, yeah, yeah, Upside Foods is a company that I started in late 2015.
> [And] the idea is, [you know], the most delicious product in the world that we've known as humans is meat.

## Jonkung

👉 will があることによって、賛成するようにするよ、という感じを出している
> Yeah, I will agree with you.

## Uma

> No disrespect to salads or greens or beans,
> [but]
> meat is the center of plate for almost every tradition in the world.

👉 be tied to
> [And] a lot of our memories growing up
>                           and
>                           also with our families now
>     `are tied to` cooking meat.

> [And] while it's the most beloved food, there's also this incredible challenge [where] we ignore how it comes to the plate.
> [And] we all know there's a troubling story of how meat comes to the plate.
> [But] we love it so much. We love the product so much, not the process so much.
> [And] there hasn't been a real solution for it until now.

👉 最後に let's say を付けて、「言わば」的な感じを出す
> [So] we've continued our journey as being conflicted `carnivores`, let's say.

👉 it would be C if S V
> [And] I thought it would be really cool

>                                                   [where] we can bring meat grown from animal cells directly to the plate.

> [So] we're not asking people to give up animal-based products,
>       [but]
>       incorporate that in the future.
> [So] the traditions can continue, the culture can continue.
> It's a `big-tent` solution [where] nearly people from `all stripes` can come together.
> [And] I've thought it will be a win-win, [but] this was at the time of an idea stage.
> It is really really hard to do it.

## Jonkung

👉 in-ing で、「に関して」
> `To put it to practice,`
>   What's been the biggest challenge so far
>     `in` gett`ing` people to, like, accept this kind of like new way of -
>       it's not even like a product in a way,
>       [but]
>       it's like a new way of accepting what meat is and what meat could be.

## Uma

> Yeah, there have been challenges along the way,
> [but] this is `unfolding` in multiple chapters.
> [So] the challenges in the first chapter were, people loved the idea
>                                                     [but]

## Uma
