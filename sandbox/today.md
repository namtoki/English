# TODAY

Currently,
I'm reviewing in detail what features will be implemented during the PreES phase.

I'm also reorganizing our expectations for each story - specifically, what Sound United expects from Eastech.

The items listed here have been largely organized, and I've made the following changes based on that review.

Regarding the items under "Added": These were not originally included in PreES, but after confirming with various Eastech members, we found that they will be included in PreES. Some of these items were already completed during the PoC phase.

Also, regarding Software Update under "Updates": After receiving feedback from Eastech that implementing Case Lighting based on update success/failure scenarios would be difficult, I now understand the challenges involved. I've consulted with our UX Team about dropping the Case Lighting requirements for updates. It looks like we'll be dropping them, so I'd like to release an updated specification as Version 2.
Thank you, Eva, Siwei, and Wayne, for your cooperation.

I'll continue to organize specific expectations for each item and determine which phase they should be implemented in.
