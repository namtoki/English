## Update

A quick update on some Story issues:
The issues assigned to me that are currently in "Working" status are items where the technical requirements have been defined.
The ones assigned to me that are marked as "Done" are features that were confirmed to be implemented during the PoC phase—specifically, Volume, Name Customization, and Software Update.

As for the items in TODO and Backlog, I'm still working on defining the technical requirements, so please bear with me.

I'd like to check the progress on the "Working" items regularly.
Regarding Manual Pairing, since the related issue has been closed, I'm thinking we could close this one as well.
Can I assume that the implementation I summarized in the comments has been completed?

Lastly, could you tell me why Touch Controls is already marked as "Done"?
Is it because the basic framework implementation is complete, and only minor adjustments to Assignable remain?

## Multi Point
So, just to clarify the next steps:
> Let me confirm the next steps:

The UI specification has been finalized,

and what the buds should be able to do is, sharing their pairing list,
> and the required features for the buds are syncing their pairing list,

actively forgetting a device,
> manually removing a device,

and actively connecting to a device.

Is that correct?
> Is my understanding correct?

These features are not part of Airoha SDK's default functionality, right?
> These aren't included in the Airoha SDK out of the box, correct?

If that's the case, the next step would be to proceed with a feasibility study with Airoha. Does that sound right?
> If so, we should move forward with a feasibility assessment with Airoha. Does that make sense?

## Jira boards
Quick question about JIRA boards:
> I have a quick question regarding JIRA boards:

Does anyone know what the "SW Related Issue" board is for? If no one's using it, I'll go ahead and delete it.
> Does anyone know the purpose of the "SW Related Issue" board? If it's not being used, I'll remove it.
