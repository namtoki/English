I have a question regarding
==brand strategy and synergies with Samsung,== ==!particularly for brands other than B&W.==

Based on various articles available online,
`it is frequently mentioned that`
Harman plans to ==actively deploy B&W as a flagship brand for automotive applications==.

Given that Harman's core revenue stream comes from automotive applications,
some speculate that ==the primary objective of acquiring Sound United was to obtain the B&W brand== specifically.
`In fact,` Samsung's official press release page regarding this acquisition featured only the Samsung and B&W logos.

I would like to hear your candid thoughts on this understanding first.

At the same time,
these articles mention that ==Samsung intends to integrate Sound United's audio technologies into consumer products==
such as smartphones, headsets, TVs, and soundbars.

Could you share
what strategic synergies are being considered between the Denon and Marantz brands and Samsung's product ecosystem?
