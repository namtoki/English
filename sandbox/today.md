# TODAY

Thanks for your comment.

I understand where you're coming from now.

Taking everything into account, I'd like to move forward with this as follows:

- UX/UI:
  - Assuming we go with the new login method, we'll proceed with the UI/UX design.
    - In other words, for now:
      - We won't factor in the engineering effort.
      - We won't consider the Denon brand apps consolidation.
- Server:
  - Around late January or early February, the team will start looking into how much effort it'll take to change the login method.
  - Depending on the results, we may need to revisit the UX/UI.

Thanks a lot.

That said, you have way more knowledge about the Airoha SDK, so if I'm off on anything, please feel free to point it out.
Also, we're still open to adopting the suggestion from the Eastech side.
