# TODAY

First things first,
we are an embedded software team, and the server team is in Sydney.

So we're not familiar with the server-side situation.

Have you already handed over all server components, such as AWS accounts and Git repositories?
I'm not sure if you're using IaC like Terraform or CloudFormation or something like that, though.

Have all of these already been handed over to our Sydney team?

My concern is that the AAT calculation part is on the server side, right?
Including that, has everything on the server side been handed over or not?

In the case of embedded source code,
AAT-related processing was kept confidential, so this was just a precautionary question.

Second,
are there any other software components related to Denon PerL other than the earbuds and cloud?
For example, what about the charging case?
And what about scripts used during the manufacturing process, such as programming the Bluetooth address, calibration, and something like that?

Also,
if there is any hardware used in debugging or manufacturing,
is it okay to send them to us even if they are simple systems like Raspberry Pi?
