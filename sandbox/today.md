# TODAY

## Intro

As Kuroishi-san mentioned earlier, there are three items on the agenda from the engineering side.

They are multipoint, key assignment, and screen design process
— things like defining all the happy path screen transitions first and deferring the edge cases for later.

## Others

I'm fine with that.

This isn't just my personal opinion — I believe it's the consensus from the engineering side.

## Personalization

It looks like Kary is back from leave — you should have received an email, right?
I've already worked with Oded to address the software-related concerns, so that's been resolved.

Could you coordinate with Kary regarding the screens that are currently marked as non-customizable?
It seems they can't fully customize them for Denon, but they're open to making some minor adjustments.
So if you could discuss specifics — like which components you'd like to change and why — that would be helpful.

## Multipoint

...

## Touch control

Sorry to jump in, but it seems there's no request to make the touch control during calls reassignable.
Apparently, they checked with sales and the call center — or whoever handles that — and there were no specific requests.
I believe Sagawa-san mentioned you about this.

Should we discuss this beforehand?
