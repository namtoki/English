# TODAY

## Jira Board 

As background, we are supposed to manage tasks with Eastech in JIRA, and the JIRA project is here.

There is also a JIRA project that manages the Denon Headphone App, here.

The PerL2 feature implementation schedule is adjusted using these JIRA projects.

First things first, in this Eastech JIRA, we've recently adjusted the rough implementation schedule in consultation with Eastech.
Almost all features are planned to be completed in the early stages.
However, some items are requested to be locked down as early as possible, such as Multipoint and Touch control.
Plus, from the software team's perspective, we need to complete the Personalization UI and Spatial Audio UI.
So they are scheduled in the early phase.

That said, regarding Multipoint, the ball is in the software team's court—we're asking Eastech how much effort will be required on their end, so please hold on for a moment.

Based on this, we've organized the app-side task schedule like this.
These tasks include some UX and PS tasks, which are created in a way that aligns well with Anders' team.

The point is, touch control tasks and connection tasks are expected to be completed this month, followed by Spatial Audio and Personalization, which are expected to finish next month.

Also, as you can see, the tasks are arranged so that many tasks are not concentrated at the same time.
This assumes we work with a lot of buffer time.
The important thing is not necessarily to work at these specific times, but rather to meet the due dates—if you finish ahead of schedule, that's perfectly fine.

## Let's set up regular meetings with Mimi and Fraunhofer if it helps to expedite the design process

I think it makes sense for our UX team and Mimi to directly discuss the App UI matters.

As you might have noticed from recent emails (you were all cc'd), I've been consulting with Karina at Mimi. These screens are provided as an out-of-the-box library and are difficult to customize the way we'd like.

The introduction and results screens are highly likely to be customizable as we need, and I've looked into the components—they seem replaceable with a more detailed API, but I need Mimi to double-check my understanding.

Also, we received a question from Mimi: "Why do you want to update the components?"
This might indicate that Mimi could adjust the out-of-the-box library to align with our required design.

I remember that May-san had a meeting with them a little while ago.
So I think it makes sense for our UX team and Mimi to directly discuss the App UI matters.

The same applies to Fraunhofer.

## Quest developers have started reviewing the Figma design files

As you might know, some members of Matsumoto-san's team have recently added comments in Figma, right?
They were busy until October because they had to deal with C-series items.
But as planned, they've become available and have started working on the PerL2 tasks.
