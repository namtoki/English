## Onboarding

Even when a user owns a C500 or C840, the app displays only PerL Pro 2 images like this, right?

My concern is whether the app intentionally avoids showing images of other products like the C500 and C840.

I understand this landing video is meant to enhance user satisfaction and engagement.
Additionally, if this landing video also serves to promote the PerL Pro 2 to users of the PerL1, C500, or C840, then this approach would make sense.

I don't think this flow enhances effectiveness, while the implementation effort is quite high.

Even if we were to adopt this approach,
I don't believe it would improve signup efficiency.
Instead, it seems like it would only increase the development workload.

Here's why:
`I understand the benefit that`
iOS and Android's built-in password management systems can automatically generate and save passwords, which saves users from manually typing them.
However, users would still need to check their email app and click the verification link.
`Since` they have to open the email app `anyway`, I don't think the number of steps is dramatically different from the current 6-digit two-factor authentication method.

we would need to prepare several onboarding screens to inform existing users when they open the app,
saying something like "The login method has changed. Please set up a new password." I'd prefer to avoid this.

Sorry, I understand that the reason you want to introduce a password feature
is because it would enable users to log in to the system without having to reenter their login information, right?

In other words, the current login system requires users to reenter their login information every time, right?

From what I've seen, the current app already handles this behavior well.
