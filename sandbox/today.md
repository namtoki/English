# TODAY

Hi, I'm Tana.
Thank you for addressing my questions in the email.

I'm a software project manager.
Our software project management team consists of two members: myself and Kuroishi, who is my team leader.
He is absent today, but you will be communicating with him in future email exchanges and meetings.

In terms of the overall software development structure,
in addition to the two of us, we have application and server development teams,
and for the embedded side, we're working with an ODM vendor for this project.

Our software project management team coordinates tasks across all these teams.

That's it.


A: Was the response in that email satisfactory?
B: Yes, thank you very much. It was sufficient. The development credential keys and everything else are working without any issues.

A: Regarding the follow-up questions, would next week be acceptable?
B: That's fine. Next week works for me. However, I would appreciate it if you could respond by around Tuesday.
