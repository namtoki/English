# TODAY

I appreciate that Eva has created some pre-ES tickets,
and I have a few things to share regarding them.

First things first, I will communicate with you guys in these tickets
about what is expected to be implemented from SoundUnited's perspective.
I will be chatting in these tickets from now on, so it would be helpful
if you guys could respond to me.

Second,

I'd like to
  close out or move forward
    the epics that are essentially done,
    in other words,
    those that have already been implemented in the PoC.

I heard PerL2's source code is derived from the PoC.

So, I think it is okay to assume that
  items already implemented in the PoC are essentially done in the PerL2 development.

For example, ticket 27 Software Update has already been done, right?
I'd like to sort out these things from now on.

Finally,

To clarify,
these schedules, start dates and end dates are up in the air for now
  since the RFQ has to be resubmitted.

So we'd like to align these schedules in the course of the pre-ES stage development.
