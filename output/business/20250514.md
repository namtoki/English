## 議題に入りそうなとき

I'd prefer to leave that to the person in charge of defining the specifications.

## KPI

PerL1
> [ChatGPT]
> As for KPIs, I'm currently working on two things:
> - Implementing user logs for PerL1, and
> - Implementing user logs for PerL2.

> For the PerL1 task, I’ve already defined `some basic steps`,
>   such as requirement understanding, design, documentation, and Submitting a request for implementation.
>
> As for the requirement understanding phase,
>   I’d like to `emphasize` that modifying the buds-side implementation is difficult, so I’m assuming we’ll only make changes on the app side.
>
> `With that in mind,` `I started by` check`ing` the Denon app

>     —such as the currently selected mode (ANC, OFF, or Passthrough), whether personalization is active, how EQs are configured, and so on.
> 
> As you’ve probably noticed, these items don’t directly `influence` the PerL2 specs.
> However, they could still provide useful insights for future development.

> I believe this understanding `is consistent with` what I discussed with May-san.

> So `the key point is:` I’m continuing this work not to define the RFQ-level PerL2 specifications we’re currently working on, `but rather` to inform future product planning.

PerL2
> [ChatGPT]
> And moving on to PerL2,
> I believe `the general direction` is
>   to base the log items on those from Pi8,
>   and add relevant items in line with the PRD, Core Requirements, and similar references.
>
> From what I’ve read on the Use Case Study page, this understanding seems to be correct.
>
> So, I started by reviewing the Pi8 logs
>   — identifying what types of logs exist, whether those logs can be stored on the buds side, and so on.
>
> Now, I have a question.
> I `came across` a log titled “Activity seen in Headphone Config Events.”
> What exactly does this refer to?
>
> I assume the key to understanding this is the term “HeadphoneConfig.”
> Does anyone `have insight into this`?
> Or should I `reach out to` David Maroto from the B&W app team?
>
> > [Original]
> > And moving on to PerL2, I believe the rough direction is, like, log items are based on Pi8's one and add appropriate items along with PRD and Core Requirement and things like that.
> > As long as I read the Use Case Study page, it is correct.
> > So I started by checking Pi8 logs, what types of logs are there?, Is this log storable in buds side? and stuff.
> > And now I have a question.
> > First, there are logs titled "Activity seen in Headphone Config Events." What is it?
> > I anticipate that the word "HeadphoneConfig" would be the key for understanding this.
> > Does anyone know about this? Or do I have to ask David Maroto, a member of B&W app team?

> Lastly, while I’ve been working on these activities,
> I’d like to mention that, as the Embedded team, I’d prefer to focus our time on studying the Airoha SDK.
> So if possible, I’d appreciate it if someone else could take on these upstream tasks.
>
> At this point, the specific details of what logs to capture haven’t been clearly defined,
> so I’d like to check whether each of them is feasible to obtain
> — but we’re currently unable to do so.

## Apple in-app

Overview
> As noted in the JIRA ticket, this matter entirely depends on the app design.
> I believe that,
>   as the app is designed to follow the flow shown in this diagram,
>   the requirements for the buds side will naturally become clear.
>
> That said,
> the PerL2 app team hasn’t been formed yet, maybe Matsumoto-san and the Quest members would be in charge.
> But they are currently busy.
>
> So, I’ve started reaching out to David Maroto on JIRA instead.
> I’m thinking it might be best to continue asking David directly about everything
> — what do you think?

Can we scan and find nearby earbuds when the app opens?

> Assuming the buds are already in pairing mode, I believe it depends on the app implementation.

Will we have all MFi capabilities?
a. Can connect to BT classic before going into app,
so OS triggers a notification to inform users to download the app (A)
> This is Apple Match, right?
> I'm not familiar with Apple Match, the best way is, I think, to ask David Maroto as well.

and (B) in app Classic pairing?
> This is the same thing.

When earbuds in proximity are discovered, can we show 1) name, 2) image, 3) colour way?
>

After in-app pairing are we connected to Bluetooth Classic, BLE, and LE Audio?
>

What battery % prevents the earbuds from being discoverable? below 1%?
> I’m happy to investigate this further if needed.
> However, I’d appreciate it if you could set a clear deadline for your response,
>   as I’m specifically concerned about whether this might become a blocker for the RFQ.

What distance (without interference) will the earbuds be discovered in?
> I believe this is also something to be confirmed from an app design perspective.
>   Additionally, it would likely depend on the signal strength design handled by the electrical engineers.
