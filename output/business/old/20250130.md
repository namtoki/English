in the first place
If we are talking about Airoha TWS Bluetooth Audio chips,
the fact is there is only a few models which are released recently.

Like 4 models or so.

Although there is only a few models, it is complicated to compare and consider them.
So we have to narrow down them to 2 or 3.

From this point of view, it is reasonable that you think the recently released model, named 1592 is the potential option.
You can see the 85, which is the previous generation of 92 but the both price are same.
so 85 have no advantage over 92.

Also 77 have huge advantage that we have experience of developing earbuds using this model.
C840 is using 77.

So we want to narrow down options to two models, 92 and 77.

For detail, you might want to see the comparison chart.

software team surely have other findings.
for example, the team is working on understanding architecture of Airoha SDK.
the reason being that we have to verify audio quality like call, ANC, or things like that at some point.
For doing that, we have to use the evaluation kit and build some firmware based on SDK.
