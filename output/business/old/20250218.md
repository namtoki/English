# JIRA

Regarding JIRA,

Thank you for handling the Jira registration. Ranslore-san.

I have sent Howard some technical questions,
and I would like to continue asking similar ones.
Would Jira be the most convenient platform for this in the first place?

Just to clarify, is my understanding correct that
the people responding on Jira are Airoha engineers?
Specifically, are they acoustic engineers or software engineers or some engineers?

I tried opening the URL you sent me, but…
It seems that a username and password are required. Could you provide me with this information?

there are a few more members I’d like to have registered.
I will send you the member list later, so could you register them at that time?

# EVK

I would like to use the EVK for functionality verification and other purposes.
I would like to know the price and delivery time for the EVK.
Specifically, I’m interested in the AB1577 and AB1592.
