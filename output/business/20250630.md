Can I double-check with you to make sure I fully understand the support status?

When I asked back in March whether Airoha’s chip supports Apple Find My, Tony told me “yes.”

And actually, if you look at the Airoha SDK release notes, it does say in version 5.3.0: “Added Apple Find My Accessory feature.”

I’ve just posted it in the chat.

By the way, this applies to TWS as well, right?
Or was it only for headphones?
Since there’s no prefix like [earbuds_ref_design] or [headset_ref_design] or anything, I assume it applies to both.

But if you look more closely, the release notes also mention: “Airoha has tested the certification cases in the Find My Network Self-Certification Test Cases R1.6.pdf file.”
Since R1.6 only defines test cases for Find My Accessory spec R1, it basically means they weren’t supporting the newer R2 spec at that point, right?

So, Airoha SDK obviously wouldn’t support the new R2 Addendum either.

And as far as I know, Apple certifications are supposed to be done based on the latest spec, which is R2, not R1.
So in reality, we can say that Airoha chips technically don’t support Find My yet, right?

Earlier, right before this meeting, I got your email.
In it, you mentioned "if we want the L bud, R bud and charging case to be displayed separately for location tracking, each bud (L and R) and charging case needs to be paired with the smartphone individually."

What is this main point?
I assume that, when implementing Apple Find My on earbuds, there’s obviously a use case where you'd want to show the left and right buds separately on the map.
But to achieve that, each bud would have to connect to the smartphone individually.
And it’s unclear whether such a setup would actually pass Apple’s certification, right?
