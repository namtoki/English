> 
> I’ve reviewed some documentation on how to merge their library into the Airoha SDK, and `from what I can see`, nothing unusual is being done.
> 
> `Just to be sure,` I had a software engineer `at` Eastech double-check it as well, and their response was essentially, “there’s no issue with the integration.”
> 
> Right now, I’m following up with Mimi on a few minor points — for example, why certain files are expected to be modified, and some implementation details.
> 
> In any case, from a software standpoint, `I believe` it would be fine to go with Mimi if everything continues to go smoothly.
> 
> By the way, the documents also include some guidelines for iOS and Android applications.
> So I think it makes sense to share them with the app team.
> Could you let me know who’s in charge of mobile app development?

Prototype

> `This part` reflects my assumptions about how it should be, so feel free to skip it.
>
> You can `generally` understand the objective of each item from its summary.
> `In addition,` you can find more detailed information in the description column.
> However, since this column is `still` being edited, it may not fully serve `its intended purpose` yet.
>
> This section is also still being edited.
> In this part, I'm planning to explain how some of the items that were `deferred` in the software feasibility study for MS2 are related to the issues listed above.
> I'm currently working on this, so you can skip this section for now.
>
> [Original]
> > This area is something that I wrote as what they should be, so you might want to skip this topic.
> > Basically, you can understand the objective on each item from its summary. On top of that, you can understand further more information from description column.
> > which is in the course of editing, so this column is not sufficient for its objective.
> > This section is also still be edited now. In this section, I'm gonna express some later items from software feasibility in MS2 are related issues listed above.
> > I'm adjusting about this now. so you can skip this section.

KPI
> I have one request — 
> if you have any suggestions such as what kind of logs you'd like to include in PerL1 or PerL2,
> it would be very helpful if you could leave a comment on this Jira issue as they come up.
