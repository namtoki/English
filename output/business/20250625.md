## UX Specification

Would it be `alright` if I added `an agenda item`?

The `topic` is about the UX specification page — I'd like to `go over` a few `detailed points`.

I have two questions.

### Reassign
First, regarding the Touch Controls for Call Making and Communication section:
There is a table `indicating that` all functions can be reassigned to other actions.
While the C500/C840 models have fixed assignments for these functions, `is it required for` the PerL2 to allow them to be reassigned as well?

`For` the C500/C840, the function assignments `have been` fixed `based on` the `findings from` benchmarking competitor products.

### Google Fast Pair
Moving on to the last question — regarding Google Fast Pair, there’s `a line` that says:
“Fallback to standard Fast Pair for Classic audio when LE Audio negotiation fails.”

Does this mean that if the BLE connection fails, the source device will automatically `attempt` to `establish` a Bluetooth Classic connection?

If so, we’ll need to conduct a feasibility study `to` determine whether this fallback behavior can be supported on the buds side.
We need to ask Eastech to investigate this implementation.

## Pro V. Standard models differentiation

The software team has two assignments from the previous meeting, and both conclusions are feasible.

### Spatial Audio
The first assignment was to determine whether Spatial Audio's additional Mode is feasible.
The answer is yes, it is feasible.

We asked both Dolby and Fraunhofer whether there are any mode configurations `or similar` functionalities.
Dolby said that it’s possible to control speaker angles, and Fraunhofer mentioned that `even more` configurations are available — `not limited to` speaker angles.
These parameters can be configured through the mobile app during music playback.

So, the next step is to define which modes we should `offer`.
Software team will share the types of parameters available in each solution, so the acoustic team or the UX team can define the specific modes accordingly.
As far as I understand, this task doesn’t need to be completed before the RFQ.
Does my understanding sound correct?

### Sound Personalization
The second assignment was about "Sound Personalization" mentioned in the EQ line.
`As I understand it,` this functionality means that the profile data used for Mimi’s personalization should also include EQ parameters.
Is that correct?

`I've thought it through`, and there’s no difficulty on the implementation side, since we plan to manage both the EQ parameters and Mimi’s personalization on the app side.
So it is feasible.

The next step would be, I think, to define the detailed use cases.
For example:
When are the Mimi personalization data and EQ parameters packaged and sent to the server?
Or similar scenarios.

Would it be okay to leave that to the UX team or PS team?
