## Chatting

Saito-san is `currently` on a business trip, and I'm not sure where he is now.

## Response

Nothing from my side.

May I add something?

## Auracast

Rio-san `has` explained this issue to the engineering team yesterday, and the embedded software team `has` taken over.

## EQ

Yes, I’ve `looked into` Airoha’s Equalizer functionality, and `a few things have come to light`.
Give me a minute — I’ll share the details `shortly`.
In the UX specification, there are three items `marked as` TBC: the number of frequency bands, whether the immersion bar needs to be implemented, and the number of custom EQ profiles.
