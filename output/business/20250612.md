## CINGO

I have a question `regarding` the integration of the Cingo SDK .

  `From what I understand,` the Cingo SDK you've introduced here is available for AB1585 and SDK v3.10, is that correct?
  `However,` the latest Airoha SDK version `appears to be` around 5.6.0.
  Has the Cingo SDK `been` integrated `into` this latest Airoha SDK?
  
  And Does the SDK support chips beyond the AB1585?
  `I'm asking because` we're planning to use AB1577 or a higher-end chip series that also `features` a HiFi5 DSP,
  similar to the AB1585 — essentially something like the AB1595.

So do you mean the SDK `works with` almost all Airoha Bluetooth chips, `as long as` they use the same DSP core, like HiFi5 or HiFi Mimi or something like that?

Does that mean we don’t have to wait for `a separate` SDK release for our target chip?

What kind of support do you provide during integration?

  Is there any platform where we can communicate with your engineers, like Jira or Redmine or something like that?
