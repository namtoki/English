## EQ spec review: custom slots max 4, stored on earbuds.

> [ChatGPT]
> Yeah, the Airoha SDK has a limitation — the maximum number of custom slots is four.
> 
> However, you can `store` additional EQ profiles on the app side.
> `By doing so`, you can effectively manage more than four slots,
> because the app can `utilize` the device’s available non-volatile memory.
> 
> So technically, the maximum number of slots is `limited only by` how much memory the app is allowed to consume.
> 
> One thing to note is that we should `avoid using` both sides, as it may `lead to` `unnecessary` complexity and potential bugs.
> 
> As you may notice, there are pros and cons `to` storing custom EQs on the buds versus on the app side.
> 
> If you store them on the buds, the EQs remain available `even if` you change your smartphone.
> `In contrast`, if you store them on the app side, the EQs remain available even if you `repurchase` the PerL2.
> 
> Which method is preferable depends on how you intend to use the PerL2.

> > If you want to restore custom EQs in the buds side, you can use them when you change your smartphone.
> > In the contrary that, if you want to restore custom EQs in the app side, you can use them when you re-buy the PerL2.
> > 
> > Whether is prior over the other depends on the use case of PerL2.

## 10 Band

> [ChatGPT]
> `I would appreciate a bit more time.`
> 
> `I'm currently` waiting for Airoha's response regarding how the MIPS usage increases as we add more EQ bands.
> However, I assume the processing load is relatively minor compared to the MIPS capacity of the HiFi chip,
> as EQ filtering is generally not a heavy DSP task.
> 
> For reference, I tested a 10-band custom EQ using the PoC, and it ran stably without any noticeable performance degradation.
