**🧑 UX Designer:**
So, `I was wondering` — what if we make the app detect when the user is walking and automatically switch to Ambient mode? Would that be possible?

### 💬 元の文：

> um, it depends. basically, Airoha SDK doesn't provide with that functionality but if you define how to catch the user walking, you can manage to implement that feature.

### ✅ 添削後の自然な表現：

> Hmm, it depends. The Airoha SDK doesn’t `natively` support that functionality, but if you can define `a reliable way to` detect when the user is walking, we `could probably` implement it on our side.

Okay, got it. Then here's another idea — can we make the app detect if someone is talking to the user and lower the volume automatically?

### 💬 元の文：

> The same thing is said to that situation as well. on top of that it is more difficult than the previous one because voices other humans emit is too difficult to perceive as talked to you.
> the part the volume is lowered is easy though.

### ✅ 添削後の自然な表現：

> It’s the same situation here — the SDK doesn’t directly support that kind of detection. On top of that, it’s actually even more difficult than the previous case,
> `since` distinguishing whether someone is talking *to* you specifically is quite challenging. That said, lowering the volume itself is `straightforward to implement`.

**🧑 UX Designer:**
I see. But maybe we don’t need to be that precise — what if we just detect any nearby speech and use that as a trigger to lower the volume? Would that make things easier?

### 💬 それに対する自然な返答例（あなたの立場）：

> Yeah, detecting nearby speech in general is `more` feasible. We could potentially use a voice activity detection (VAD) algorithm for that.
> `The challenge would be` balancing sensitivity and `false positives` — we don’t want the volume to drop `every time` someone coughs or a train announcement plays.
> `But in principle, yes, it’s doable.`

**🧑 UX Designer:**
Thanks, that makes sense. `Let me ask you one more thing` — can we make the app detect if the user has taken their earbuds off and automatically pause the music?

### 💬 元の文：

> Yeah, I think that is doable. The buds incorporate a proximity sensor and it can detect if the user wear the bud. more thing, the Airoha SDK natively support that feature using a proximity sensor.

### ✅ 添削後の自然な表現：

> `Yes,` I think that’s doable. The buds `are equipped with` a proximity sensor, which can detect whether the user is wearing them. On top of that, the Airoha SDK natively supports this feature `out of the box`.

| **Yeah** → **Yes**                  | 会議中では少し丁寧な「Yes」がベターです。                                                         |
| **The buds incorporate...**         | OK ですが、"are equipped with" の方が一般的な言い方。                                         |
| **if the user wear**                | "wear" は三単現の "wears" にする必要がありました。また、より自然には "is wearing them"。                  |
| **more thing**                      | "One more thing" や "On top of that" の方が自然。                                     |
| **natively support** → **supports** | 主語は "SDK"（三人称単数）なので "supports"。また "out of the box" を加えるとより明確に「すぐ使える機能」と伝えられます。 |

That’s great to hear. But what happens if the user takes off just one earbud? Can we pause only one channel or maybe switch to mono audio on the remaining side?

### 💬 元の文：

> If you want to follow the general behavior, we should make both buds pause the music even if the user detach the one. but in principle, pausing only one channel, switching to mono audio, both are also feasible. the mount of software implementation would increase though.

### ✅ 添削後の自然な表現：

> If we want to follow standard behavior, we should have both buds pause the music even if the user removes just one. That said, pausing only one channel or switching to mono audio is technically feasible as well — `it would just` require more software work on our side.

| **"detach the one"** → **"removes just one"**                        | "detach" は機械的に外す、という印象が強いので、"removes" の方が自然。"the one" も「just one」の方が明確で会話的。                                        |

| **"both are also feasible"** → **"is technically feasible as well"** | 主語が "pausing only one channel or switching to mono audio" のため、単数扱いに（「どちらかが feasible」のニュアンス）。"technically" を足して丁寧に。 |

### 💬 さらに少しフォーマルにしたバージョン（上司向けでも安心）：

> Typically, both earbuds pause playback when one is removed, and that's the behavior users are familiar with.
> However, from a technical standpoint, we could explore options like pausing just one channel or switching to mono on the remaining bud
> — `it would just` come with additional development effort.
