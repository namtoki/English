I'm an optimist
and
I think, `in order for us to be able to solve these immense challenges ahead of us`,    `目的を先に述べるパターン`
  it's going to require
    the worldview of optimism, but a very pragmatic view of solutions.
    and
    `going at it over and over again`.

Because
  `what might not have worked`
    a month ago or a week or even a year ago or a decade ago,
 `would work now`.                                                                      `what V しなかったものが、今は V するようになるだろう`

`A focus on the optimism` is, `I think`, what we need for like younger generation         `無生物主語、I think の挿入`
and
I do think, your work is one of those examples of good things.

`The connection with food itself, it` always goes back to childhood for me.             `名詞, it`
And
I grew up in the kitchen, so to speak, with my mom, `trying` to cook everything she did.`その理由を述べたいので分詞構文`
I used to watch her,
  tried to help her chop vegetables,
        or go to the market and bring back meat and slice meat,
and `kind of`
  wanted to cook from day one.

## Business

If I had to say, who has the ball for deciding which service to use for Voice Prompt?

In the meeting, we concluded that the only way to decide on a TTS service is to check with native speakers.

I don’t think the software team is in a position to take the lead anymore.
Reaching out to native speakers of different languages in the company and running evaluations
isn’t really software development anymore, is it?

I strongly believe the UX team should take care of this task. Should we create a Jira task for it and assign it to Mei?

- ような機能ですよね？                          `So this is a feature where S V when ___ happens, right?`
- 以前話していましたよね？                      `You talked about this before, right?` what did we decide at that time?
- すいません、引き継ぐ時間がありませんでした    Apologies, I didn’t have the opportunity to do the `handover` from Kuroishi-san.
- 正確なことは言えないが                        `I can't say for sure` without checking, but..

- どっちを重視する？                            `Should the focus be`
                                                `on` natural ambient sound passthrough
                                                `or`
                                                `on` making face-to-face conversations easier?
                                                or should multiple modes be provided to accommodate both?
- とは思うのだが                                `I assume` one of them is a typo,
                                                but in Chapter 4's GIVEN WHEN THEN part, `it says` 'THEN pause audio,'
                                                while in Chapter 5, Section 2, `it says` 'lower the media volume.' Which one is correct?

If the only goal is to speed up login, I don’t think it’s necessary.

- によるのでは？                                Whether we include this feature or not `depends on` what kind of experience we want the users to have, right?
- もし～するなら、それは～だ                    For example, `if` we set up a Denon Headphone portal where users can log in with a common account and buy replacement parts,
                                                `that would be` a real benefit.
                                                Without designing a user experience like that, it's hard to say if this makes sense.

- ～～は、具体的には何をしますか？              `What exactly does` the "immersion setting" do?
- を採用するか否か                              I don’t think we’ve decided `whether to go with` "Immersion" `or not` in the first place.
- 以前報告させていただきました通り、            `As I mentioned before,` in PerL, Immersion is basically just a low-frequency filter.
- で構わない                                    Personally, `I’m fine with` keeping it as 'Immersion' or redefining it as one of the bands in the existing ProEQ.
When considering this, please also think about whether we should keep the Immersion feature as it is.

Of course, I’m sure there are some app-side limitations too.
Bluetooth-spec-wise, it should be possible to handle more strings

- に寄与する                                    If I'm not mistaken, limiting the number of characters `helps with` power saving.
                                                That’s because when a device advertises itself, more characters mean more data to transmit.
