Jonkung
> A focus on the optimism is, (I think,) what we need for (like) younger generation `無生物主語` `I think の挿入` `繋ぎ言葉 like`
> and
> I do think, your work is one of those examples of good things.

Uma
> The connection with food itself, it always goes back to childhood for me.         `名詞, it V`
>
> And
> I grew up in the kitchen, (so to speak,) with my mom,
> trying to cook everything she did.                                                `その理由を述べたいので分詞構文`

> I used to watch her, tried to help her chop vegetables,
>                            or go to the market and bring back meat and slice meat,
> and
> (kind of) wanted to cook from day one.                                            `and の後で並列の主語を省略`
> 
> but
> I realized some of my skills weren't great.
> 
> So
> I went to school in India,
>
> And
> there was this hawker who was right outside our school
>
> And
> I was fascinated with his work
> because
> he used to sell the fast foods of India called dhaji (and things like that)       `とかとか`
>
> But
> the way he chopped onions, (just,) I was `hooked onto it`.                          `名詞, I V it` `もうほんとに just`
> because
> he would slice them up,
> (like,) he'll take an onion, and 10 seconds, the whole thing will be sliced and diced like, finely.
> I'm like, I'm going to master that.
>
> So
> I became the master slicer-dicer of onions in my house.
>
> And
> (later on in food,) (obviously,) (look,)                                          `ほら、ねぇ look`
> it's the most creative expression of anything you can do in a daily life.

> And
> I love to cook with my wife and kids,
> and
> it's just became part of my life.
>
> And ...
>
> What about yours?
> What's your personal connection to food?

Jonkung
> My personal connection to food, (as you said,) it is an expression of my creativity,  `名詞, M, it V`
> but
> it is also a way that we express our culture
>            and
>            a way that we `pass down` our culture.
>
> So
> (growing up in Hong Kong as well as Toronto,)
> food was very much a way that I `was attached to` the things that my parents loved as well as my grandparents.
>
> Um,
> My own `grasp on` Cantonese language is very, very, weak.
> (because of all the traveling that we did when I was younger
>
> So
> I felt like relearning cultural dishes was a way that I would easily `get in contact with` my roots.
> (`without having to` learn a language)

Uma
> What did food mean to you when you were growing up in Hong Kong?

Jonkung
> (I mean,) (food,) I was very, very blessed.                                       `ええと I mean` `名詞のみで話題を示す`
> Hong Kong, as is India, has a very rich culinary history.
>                         and
>                         actually shares a little similar ones in terms of,
>                         (I would guess)

Uma
> Is it the spices?                                                                     `Is it O?`

Jonkung
> Well, `imperialism`.
