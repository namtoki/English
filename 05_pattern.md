I'm an optimist
and
I think, in order for us to be able to solve these immense challenges ahead of us,
  it's going to require
    the worldview of optimism, but a very pragmatic view of solutions.
    and
    going at it over and over again.

Because
  what might not have worked a month ago or a week or even a year ago or a decade ago, would work now.
