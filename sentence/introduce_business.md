# Introduce myself

Hi, Name's Toshiyuki.
But I usually go by Toshi.

Pleasure to meet you.

I'm a software developer.
and supposed to be assigned to this project as the Japan-side technical leader with Kuroishi-san.

I have like 10 years of experience in various embedded software field.
For instance, UAV which is called drone generally, storages such as SSD, and stuff.

I'm super excited to work with you.

# Question

Honestly, I heard this assignment this Tuesday.
So, My preparation is not adequate.

Off the top of my head,
I'm concerned about whether there are any documents which have some information like memory map design and port assignment design.

If I'm not mistaken, we can use either Windows or Linux as environment OS, right?
Is there recommendation which one is better?
This is just out of curiosity, but I want to know that just in case.

Actually, I tried compile source in accordance with README yesterday.
And I understood about ADK Toolkit and MDE a little bit.
But I'm not sure how and when to use Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool.

for now

(Q1) We want to use the current PerL Pro earbuds (QCC5171) for our study/debug/test because some of us already have ones. But it’d be later even after Oct-Nov-2024. Is my understanding correct? Even if it’s correct, we’ll be fine to get the BAT QCC repo (QCC5181) for our study w/o using BAT earbuds.
We’d like to know the code structure (what folder/file owns what function, etc.) in the call.
We’d like to know how to build the source codes.
We’d like to know how to install the firmware onto the earbuds. What is required to do that?
We’d like to know how to debug, as well.
