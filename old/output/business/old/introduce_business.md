# Introduce myself

Hi, Name's Toshiyuki Tanamura.
But I usually go by Tana in my personal life.

Pleasure to meet you.

<!-- I'm a software developer. -->
<!-- and was assigned to this project as the software leader with Kuroishi-san. -->

There may be many people who see me for the first time even in the Japan team.
The reason being that, I joined this company last October.
So, it hasn't been a year since I started work here.

But, instead of that,
I have around 10 years of experience in various embedded software field.

Such as, drone, SSD, and stuff.

So I hope I can help you in software development.

I'll do my best.

I'm super excited to work with you.

In terms of software stucks,
C, C++, Linux, ROS which is used robotics dicipline, Python, and so on.

We are reading Qualcomm's QCC documents here and there.
And starting to read source code of Nura's repositories.

Regarding of our current situation,
We are gradually understanding these architecutre.

My short-term goal is to get to customise Perl Pro's tiny features and debug these no later than the middle of Octorber.

# Question

Honestly, I heard this assignment this Tuesday.
So, My preparation is not adequate.

Off the top of my head,
I'm concerned about whether there are any documents which have some information like memory map design and port assignment design.

If I'm not mistaken, we can use either Windows or Linux as environment OS, right?
Is there recommendation which one is better?
This is just out of curiosity, but I want to know that just in case.

Actually, I tried compile source in accordance with README yesterday.
And I understood about ADK Toolkit and MDE a little bit.
But I'm not sure how and when to use Qualcomm Audio Calibration Tool.

for now

(Q1) We want to use the current PerL Pro earbuds (QCC5171) for our study/debug/test because some of us already have ones. But it’d be later even after Oct-Nov-2024. Is my understanding correct? Even if it’s correct, we’ll be fine to get the BAT QCC repo (QCC5181) for our study w/o using BAT earbuds.
We’d like to know the code structure (what folder/file owns what function, etc.) in the call.
We’d like to know how to build the source codes.
We’d like to know how to install the firmware onto the earbuds. What is required to do that?
We’d like to know how to debug, as well.
