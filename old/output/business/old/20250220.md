They have also provided a feasibility list, and so far, it aligns with our understanding.
The software team has not made any progress on the Personalization feature. Saito-san and Fukushima-san are the ones working on it.

## 1577 and 1592

I know that there are no functional differences between the two chips,
and the only distinction lies in the quality of audio-related features, such as ANC.

## License fee

I am planning to resume the investigation into the licensing fees for LC3. However, I believe there are other features that also require licensing fees. For example, Spatial Audio, if using Dolby’s solution.  

Someone needs to coordinate with the ODM vendor to confirm these licensing fee things as well.

    Is it okay if I take charge of this?
    It’s slightly outside the typical scope of the software team, but got it.

Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.

## AptX

Sorry to interrupt, but I have one thing I'd like to discuss.

Regarding AptX,
since this is a Qualcomm solution, it is clear that Airoha cannot support it.
However, is there a requirement to support another high-quality audio codec as an alternative?

    What's your take on? Steve-san

---

By the way, according to the page where the requirements are summarized, LDAC is not planned to be supported.
    Who is responsible for updating that page?
    Am I allowed to update it myself?
but, as a reference,
It seems that the previous model, C500, will support LDAC via OTA.
In that case, would it be natural for PerL2 to support LDAC as well?

---

This is just a side note, but…
Personally, I believe that sound quality is determined not by the codec but by the drivers used or Speakers or other hardware things.
The main benefit of supporting LDAC would probably be the ability to print the logo on the product packaging.
That's why I don't think there is a need to support LDAC.

I believe that other codecs, such as LHDC, are also unnecessary for the same reason.

    Well, if you think about it, that makes sense. Got it!

## 2 doings

Regarding Transparency Mode,
we are currently verifying whether it can switch based on the voice of the conversation partner.
Airoha has mentioned that they are developing this feature,
but we are checking its accuracy and when it will be integrated into the SDK.

We are investigating whether such ANC and Transparency settings can be configured in Airoha.
This involves reviewing the Android-side SDK and consulting with Airoha representatives.

What we know so far is that the ANC/Transparency level can be adjusted separately only when it is not in Adaptive ANC mode.
However, the resolution is low. For example, it is unclear which specific audio filters the ANC level affects.
To be precise, I need to analyze the source code further before making any definitive statements.

Please give me a little more time to continue the investigation.

Regarding Sound Dose,
it is currently close to being *not feasible*.
Airoha has mentioned that there are no third-party providers for this feature at the moment.
but Just in case, we are checking if there are any third parties offering similar functionality, but the chances seem slim.

## TTS

I also don’t see much benefit in embedding the TTS engine directly into the earbuds.
Rather, it could potentially introduce many bugs related to language switching.

Nura hosts its source code on GitHub,
and from what I can see in the repository,
there is a workflow that runs on the GitHub server at key commit events.
This workflow executes various voice prompt service APIs and receives the corresponding audio files.
