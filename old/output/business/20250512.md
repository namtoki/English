## Personalization

> [ChatGPT]
> `I’d like to confirm one thing.`
> For this issue, I’ve `defined the goal as`:
> “To clarify whether there are any obstacles for Eastech to incorporate Mimi’s library into the Airoha embedded SDK.”
> `Based on that,` my conclusion is:
> “No, there are no obstacles,” and I’m planning to close the issue.
>
> If you have any additional concerns or expectations regarding points that may still be unclear, please feel free to let me know.

> > I have a thing that I want to confirm.
> > In this issue, I've set the goal as "To clarify if there are any obstacles in way that Eastech incorporates Mimi's library in the Airoha embedded SDK or not."
> > Given that, my answer is "No, there is no obstacle" and this issue is going to be closed.

## ANC

> [ChatGPT]
> `Let me clarify the scope of this issue.`
> `The purpose here is to` address everything related to ANC/Passthrough level settings via the app.
> That said, the goal `is not to` finalize the full specification, `but rather to` define the RFQ-stage spec.
>
> And there are, I think, two main items to cover in this issue:
> 1. The minimum and maximum effectiveness levels for each mode (Static ANC, Transparency)
> 2. The UI design for mode switching and adjusting effectiveness levels
>
> Regarding Item 1:
> `As long as` the RFQ doesn’t require precise filter gain values, I believe it’s sufficient to define the goal more broadly — for example, “Our ANC should surpass that of Bose.”
> For now, `would it be acceptable to` assume the following ranges?
> 1. ANC: -30dB to 0dB
> 2. Passthrough: 0dB to +6dB
> These values can be `revised` later during the acoustic tuning phase, if more appropriate ranges are identified.
>
> Regarding Item 2:
> As I mentioned earlier, both option 1a and 1b are technically feasible.
> I believe the decision depends on how preset values are to be stored and restored.
> Please discuss this further with the PS team.
>
> If there are any unclear points related to either software or acoustic matters, feel free to let me know.
>
> Of course, as you mentioned, we’d like to compare the effectiveness of ANC and Passthrough with other companies’ products,
> and also evaluate the smoothness of transitions when adjusting the levels via the slider — for example, by using the H100 as a reference.
> We’re planning to conduct those evaluations either during the PoC phase or in a later stage.
> (@Yusaku Morita , that sounds right to you, doesn’t it?)

> > Let me straighten things through.
> > In this issue, I'd like to solve all the things about ANC/Passthrough level settings via app.
> > And the goal is, I think, determining not the final spec but the RFQ stage spec.
> > 
> > Based on that, there are two items on this issue.
> > 
> > 1. The minimum/maximum effectiveness of each modes (Static ANC, Transparency)
> > 2. The UI to change modes and each effectiveness
> > 
> > About the point 1, it is sufficient that we should define the goal as, for example, "Our ANC have to surpass the one of Bose" unless the RFQ spec needs the accurate values of filter gain.
> > So is it okay if the values are -30db ~ 0db for ANC and 0db ~ 6db for Passthrough for now.
> > Those values might be updated if it turns out that any other values are reasonable in the course of tuning acoustic things at the later stage.
> > 
> > About the point 2, as I answered, Both 1a and 1b are well from engineering perspective.
> > I think it depends on the way to restore the preset of these modes.
> > Please look into that with PS team.
> > 
> > If you have any unclear points that is related with software or acoustic thing, please let me know.

## Apple in-app

> Thank you for your comment.
> It seems that we’re on the same page.
> 
> From my point of view, the app team should mainly take the lead on this task — as I’m part of the embedded software team.
> 
> My role here is to implement the necessary embedded firmware behavior (such as Bluetooth/BLE emissions) based on the app requirements, and maybe to ensure that we obtain the required MFi certification.
> 
> By the way, do you know who is involved in app development for PerL2?
> I assume Anders is one of them — is that correct?
> If so, I think it would be necessary to include him in the meeting when we discuss this topic.
