Let me hear you out first.

Regarding HRTF personalization, you mentioned using a dedicated API to measure head size on iOS
— are there any OS version limitations for that on iOS or Android?
Like, is it only available on newer versions?

Some features don’t work on older OS versions because certain APIs aren’t available, right?

As for the communication between the mobile app and Cingo,
there aren’t any specific requirements, so we’re assuming we can define our own Bluetooth service or something like that.

## CINGO

I have a question `regarding` the integration of the Cingo SDK .

  `From what I understand,` the Cingo SDK you've introduced here is available for AB1585 and SDK v3.10, is that correct?
  `However,` the latest Airoha SDK version `appears to be` around 5.6.0.
  Has the Cingo SDK `been` integrated `into` this latest Airoha SDK?
  
  And Does the SDK support chips beyond the AB1585?
  `I'm asking because` we're planning to use AB1577 or a higher-end chip series that also `features` a HiFi5 DSP,
  similar to the AB1585 — essentially something like the AB1595.

So do you mean the SDK `works with` almost all Airoha Bluetooth chips, `as long as` they use the same DSP core, like HiFi5 or HiFi Mimi or something like that?

Does that mean we don’t have to wait for `a separate` SDK release for our target chip?

What kind of support do you provide during integration?

  Is there any platform where we can communicate with your engineers, like Jira or Redmine or something like that?

There should be an API that sends the sensor fusion data to the DSP,
so I think we can just simulate it in software by calling that API with various values.

## Spec Diff

I looked over the table the UX team put together, and it doesn’t seem like there’s much that involves hardware.
If anything, most of it looks like it’ll require effort on the app side.

The Airoha SDK does not currently support exposing this type of information.

`I see that` the row for EQ mentions 'Sound Personalization'. `How does that differ from` the content listed two rows below?

Technically, this is feasible.
However, `it would require` some effort to define the specifications,
and `there are concerns that` it could increase the workload and complexity for the App team and QA team.
