I haven't been able to follow up on this yet, and the person in charge is off today, so we'll get back to you tomorrow.

## Pro versus Standard differentiation

Overall, I think this looks feasible, but I'd like to confirm a few things.

However, please go ahead and check each item one by one. I’ll ask questions as we go.

[Battery]
regarding battery health...
I’ve heard that the gas gauge IC `is capable of` providing time-related information,
so the electrical design team is currently looking into it.

  Kind of, yeah.
  
  If the gas gauge solution turns out `to be insufficient`,
  it `may be possible` to `estimate` these times on the app side by analyzing changes in battery percentage over time.
  
  `To clarify,` this would be a statistical-based approach.
  The assumptions are:
  
    the app can access the device’s battery level
    the app can retrieve that information periodically
    the app can determine whether the device is currently charging
  
  `Based on these assumptions`, it is technically feasible to estimate time-to-full or time-to-empty
    using an Extended Kalman Filter, which is a type of state-space model.
  
  That said,
  I cannot `guarantee` the accuracy of the assumed values,
  and additional time would be needed to fine-tune the Kalman filter gains during the actual product development.
  
  In short, this approach is technically possible `to` implement on the app side alone, but it would be a significant challenge.

[ANC]
about Wind Noise Reduction — is it correct to assume that it's always ON when ANC is ON?

From what I saw in the Airoha SDK, it looks like this setting can actually be toggled ON or OFF.
That said, I think keeping it always ON is fine, especially since allowing it to be toggled would just increase the number of test cases.

[Spatial Audio]
The Additional Mode is like a preset for Spatial Audio, right?
Any rough idea of what modes you're thinking of?

Just to be sure, let me double-check with the person in charge.
I’ll get back to you with a final answer on feasibility tomorrow.

[EQ]
What does the "Sound Personalization" mentioned here refer to?
How is it different from the item listed two rows below?

---

[Sound Dose]
Yes, in the Airoha SDK, there’s a state called "Realtime Clock Mode", and using this mode makes the feature feasible.
However, I believe the actual power consumption of this mode hasn’t been fully evaluated yet.

---

[Smart Pose]
How is this different from the In-ear detection we talked about earlier?
From what I understand, both seem to allow enabling or disabling Auto Pause based on the IR sensor's detection state — is that right?

## Hearing test draft flow diagram - open questions to the team

### opportunity
Sorry, I thought I had already replied.
As mentioned here, it's possible to play a specific audio file during the fit test in the Airoha mobile app.
There’s an API available for that.

However, we do need to design and decide what kind of audio files to include in the lineup.

### stationary
Sorry, quick update on this.

It looks like there isn’t an API to convert non-stationary noise into a level and expose it to the mobile app.

However, there is an API to get the stationary noise level,
and since that’s already used to adjust ANC gain levels based on ambient noise, I think using that should be totally fine.

So let’s consider this feasible.
