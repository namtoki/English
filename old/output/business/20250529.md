## Personalization

> Yes, what I did was a review from the embedded software perspective.
> I also looked a bit into some server-related matters.
> As I mentioned `earlier`, there are no obstacles to `integrating` Mimi’s SDK into Airoha’s SDK.
> Regarding security, we can collaborate with Mimi on the server-side implementation to `ensure that` no personal data is stored on the Mimi server.

> All things considered, there are no issues from the software side.

## Form App/Server team

> [ChatGPT]
> Yes, our embedded software team asked Anders last Thursday whether his team could `take over` the App and Server-related tasks, and he agreed.
> We’ve already informed him of the schedule and some key features from the App and Server perspectives, including Mimi integration and Apple in-app pairing.
> `Hopefully,` they’ll begin designing the App and Server soon, `in collaboration with` Mimi.

As the software team, we can look into how much of a difference can be made,
but we’d like PS team to decide how much of a difference there should actually be within that range.

With that in mind, it would be helpful if PS team or UX team could roughly share which features you'd like to differentiate, and in what way.
