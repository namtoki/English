The firmware for Perl2 `was ported from` Perl1.
In other words, the additional source code originally based on the QCC5171 SDK has `been migrated` to run on the QCC5181 SDK.

As a result, the current firmware generally supports the same features that were available in Perl1.
However, it’s important to note that this was `purely a migration effort`—we didn’t design and implement each feature `from scratch`.
So right now, it's almost like: some features just happen to work after the migration, `rather than being` fully validated or re-developed for the new platform.

As you've noticed, many features are currently not supported.
This may be due to differences in the base SDK, changes in peripheral chips, or other such factors.

`Given this situation`, even small bugs can have a big impact and may take considerable time to fix.

Below are the unsupported features we've identified, mostly based on actual device behavior:

- Shipping mode
- Entering ANC tuning mode
- Using the microphone with cVc
- Touch controls
- Some charging behaviors

As for tuning, `it should be possible to` adjust parameters that are controllable through QACT.
