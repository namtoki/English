My Job

I am a software engineer. I work at D&M holdings.
D&M holdings is a company that develop audio and video devices like AV receivers, amplifiers,  headphones, and so on.

I am in charge of developing common software.
Common software is the software used in almost all products.
For example, music information displayed on front panel of the product.

We develop so many devices every year.
It is too busy to develop a new device from full scratch, so I and my team develop common software to all products.
