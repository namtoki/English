not Bad.
but I don't feel satisfied because I left work with half-finished.

Last Saturday, I went to the Yokohama Stadium and watch a baseball game with my wife.
And Sunday, a new projector I bought in a flea market application arrived.

So this weekend was so fun.

we had a seated around first baseline.

It was so disappointing because our team lose.
