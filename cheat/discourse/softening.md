- [ ] `I didn't mean it`                    ([Casual] そういうつもりじゃなかった) `I didn't mean it`; I was just joking.
- [ ] `I was just saying`                   ([Casual] ただ言ってただけだよ) `I was just saying,` maybe we should try a different approach.
- [ ] `That's not to say (that) S V`        ([Neutral] だからといって～というわけではない) `That's not to say that` I disagree, but I have some concerns.
