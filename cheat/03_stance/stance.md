# STANCE

## スタンスを調整

- [ ] `if anything`                         ([Casual] どちらかと言えば／むしろ) `If anything,` this situation calls for more caution.
- [ ] `if I had to say/guess`               ([Casual] しいて言うなら／あえて推測するなら) `If I had to guess,` they’ll arrive late.
- [ ] `if I'm not mistaken`                 ([Neutral] 間違っていなければ) `If I'm not mistaken,` the meeting is at 3 p.m.
- [ ] `in the first place`                  ([Neutral] そもそも／初めから) I shouldn’t have trusted him `in the first place.`

## 感情を乗せる

- [ ] `I can't tell you how much S V`       ([Casual] どれだけ～か言い表せない) `I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.`
