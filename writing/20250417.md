## Fit test

> [ChatGPT]
>
> First off, this is about the fit test.
> `As we already know,` Airoha’s fit test only gives a binary result  —  either “Good” or “Bad.”
>
> This method `seems to be focused` just on detecting if the ear tip is too small.
> `But on the flip side,` it probably can’t detect if the ear tip is too large.
>
> So we’ll need an additional algorithm that can handle that kind of “too large” pattern.
> For instance, if someone uses oversized ear tips, the earbuds might not `sit consistently` in the ear,
>   which could cause differences in ANC effectiveness between the left and right sides
>   or maybe make IR sensor readings unstable.
> `That said,` these are just `assumptions` for now.
>
> Anyway, we need to figure out `what kind of` algorithm would `make sense for` PerL2.
> To move forward, let’s run some tests, monitor logs, and take it from there using PoC or later.
>
> Also, I’d like us to keep checking if this feature is really necessary.
> From a UX perspective, once we take a step back and think about it, we might realize it’s not something users actually need all that much.

## ANC

> [ChatGPT]
> And this is just recap — `I'm currently` check`ing` with the Airoha team about the acurate gain ranges for ANC and Passthrough.
> `Once I have the details,` I’ll get back to you.

> [Draft]
> > And this is just recap. I'm asking Airoha team ANC and Passthrough gain range now.
> > Once turns out them, I'll get back to you.
