Today was tough.
I usually have a weekly meeting on Thursdays where all the project members, including those from the UK, get together.
On top of that, I had another meeting today where I was the main one explaining a topic.
These meetings were `back-to-back`, so I’m really exhausted.
As always, I prepared a full script before the meeting, and I think I was able to get my thoughts across to the UK members.
But when they responded to what I said, I started rambling a bit — which, when I think about it, is kind of understandable.
So I felt like I need to build up a `mental stockpile` of ready-to-use phrases for those moments.
