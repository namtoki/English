## Personalization

Understood.

From the Embedded Software Team’s perspective,
    we’ve ranked the three candidates in the following order:
        Audeara, Audiodo, and then Mimi.

The five-point scale makes the differences look significant,
    but in reality, the gaps are quite small compared to other teams' evaluations.

Audeara `came out on top` mainly because the JDM vendor has past experience using it.
On the other hand, Mimi `ended up` lower in the ranking due to its server dependency.

Let me briefly `walk you through` the breakdown of our evaluation.

We assessed each vendor based on four key criteria:

1. Implementation Limitation
Here, we `looked at` whether the solution could realistically be implemented on Airoha
    — in other words, whether the size of the library and data would fit within Flash.
`In this area`, all vendors were quite close, and as expected, none of them had excessive memory requirements.

2. Architecture
We analyzed how the data is generated, stored, and transferred — across the buds, the app, and the server.
For example, `with` Audiodo, the system diagram shows that the server isn’t necessarily required.
But `with` Mimi, server-side processing is essential and cannot be removed.
We asked if they’d allow us to host the server ourselves, but they declined.
`To be clear`, using their server wouldn’t be a major issue, but it could be a bit of a hassle when we need to document or address potential security risks
— so we slightly downgraded them for that.

3. Functional Limitation
`This is where` we checked if the personalization feature might interfere with any existing functionality.
According to each vendor’s implementation, their processing is added at the end of the audio graph,
`which means` it won’t affect earlier-stage components like EQ or Spatial Audio.
However, we’ll still need to keep an eye on MIPS usage to ensure it doesn’t exceed limits, especially during actual implementation.

4. Development Experience
We checked whether any of the JDM vendors had experience with these solutions.
Only Audeara has been used in a past product developed by Eastech. The other two haven’t been used yet by Eastech and Fujikon,
so we gave a slight edge to Audeara here.

`So based on all of this`, our current ranking is Audeara > Audiodo > Mimi.

That's it.

Let us know if you have any questions.


## ANC

I have a quick reminder and a report to share.

As for the reminder
I’ve thought the range and adjustable steps for ANC and Passthrough effectiveness levels.
I’ve already `noted` the tentative results in the Jira issue, so May-san, could you `take a look` and let me know `if anything seems off`?

Of course, these values `are subject to` change as we move forward with acoustic tuning or testing with actual buds.

## Ear fit

And regarding the report —
`As I mentioned before`, we have two options for the ear fit test: Airoha’s default version and Audeara’s custom implementation.

Audeara’s solution would likely be our last `resort`, since `it requires us to` pay an additional development fee, I think.
`So ideally`, we should consider basing our fit test implementation on Airoha’s default one.

Now, Airoha’s fit test is based on how much low-frequency sound is leaking out, as I explained earlier.
This algorithm can only detect when the ear tip is too small. The key point is that it’s not able to detect when the ear tip is too large.

That said, I think there might be a way to identify overly large tips `by observing` how certain firmware parameters behave.
    For example,
    if the ear tips are too large, the fit and `orientation` of the buds may become `inconsistent` between the left and right sides
    — unlike when using smaller tips.
    `This could result in` differences in ANC effectiveness between the two sides, and that fluctuation in ANC parameters might give us a clue to detect the “too large” case.

There may be other approaches as well — `this is just one possibility`.

`The bottom line is that` I can’t really determine the feasibility until I actually debug with the real hardware.
So I’d suggest `pushing this task to` after MS3.

In the meantime and moving into the implementation phase, I’ll also ask the JDM vendors to `explore` concrete implementation ideas.
