## Voice Detection

> `This is my update.`
> The report is straightforward: this feature is not feasible.
> 
> It turns out that Eastech does not `have the capability to` develop this feature on their own.
> Although Airoha plans to release an SDK that includes this feature, `the timeline is` around Q2 of 2026, which does not `align with` our development schedule.
> 
> Given that, it’s not feasible for us to proceed with this feature.

> [できるっていってたじゃん言われたら]

> [JBL について言われたら]
> > It’s true that JBL has implemented an equivalent feature,

> 
> [もっと調査してと言われたら]
> > I understand your point — but what exactly are you expecting me to do? Master the entire Airoha SDK?
> > That doesn’t seem like a pragmatic approach, does it?

> > [Original]
> > This is from me.
> > The report is straitforward.
> > This function is not feasible.
> > Because it turns out that Eastech does not have the capability to develop this feature in themselves.
> > Although Airoha plans to release the SDK including this feature, it will be around 26/Q3. So this is not suit to our development schedule.

> > In conclusion, this is not feasible.

> > Yes, I think they said they can implement this feature theoretically.
> > But at the result of the Eastech's further investigation, it turns out that this is much difficult to implement by themselves.
> > 
> > Yeah, JBL implemented the equivalent feature but it seems that it's their original implementation other than SDK's original feature.

> > I see your point, but what do I have to do? master the Airoha SDK? That is not pragmatic way, right?
