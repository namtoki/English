Comprehension, comprehension as I`'ve` said before`,` is the key to success in language ~journey~`learning`.
It's not difficult to say something.
It's not difficult to come up with `a` sentence~s~.`,` ~I~`a` limited meaning ~which one get close~`that you want to get across`.
`But` when ~I was~`you're` speaking ~with~`to` a native speaker who has ~attended~`tens of` thousands of words that ~tension you~`they potentially could` use`,`
many different ways ~are repressed~`of expressing` the same thought `or` responding `to what` you have said,
`if` you ~have~`haven't` got~ten~ good comprehension, you are not ~been~`gonna be in the` conversation very long.
You can struggle to get your ~wrong menu~`own meaning across,` ~when~`but` you ~are close by~`have to have` good comprehension.
`How do you get good comprehension?`
I think `there are` 5 concepts that I have`n't` felt in my own experience have been `very` useful to me.

The first one is we have to get `rid of the old` idea that we have to know 95% of the words in ~that~`any` given context in order to be `able to` benefit from `that`.
Well, first of all, I`'ve` found that even 5% of the words if I ~have not~`don't` know those words, it's frustrating to read.
And `in fact, that's what got me` going `in`to ~link~`LingQ is I had books in` Spanish ~or~`and` German `with on every page, you know, 10 words that I didn't know,`
`and I would look them up in a dictionary and I would forget them.`

So that's not that comfortable in fact, `although you get a general sense of the meaning.`
However, nowadays, with online dictionaries, and with system like LingQ, I personally found that `10 to` 15% unknown words
is like a sweet spot `where` I'm getting more vocablary, because if you ~were~`are` hoping `to` improve your comprehension and improve your vocablary,
if you are only ~reading words~`dealing with` texts that have 5% new words, you ~would~`will` take forever ~doing~`to` increase your vocablary to
~our~`a` level ~for~`where` you can ~do~`be` comfortable in a ~library~`wide variety of contexts.`
