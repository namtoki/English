Comprehension, comprehension as I`'ve` said before`,` is the key to success in language ~journey~`learning`.
It's not difficult to say something.
It's not difficult to come up with `a` sentence~s~.`,` ~I~`a` limited meaning ~which one get close~`that you want to get across`.
`But` when ~I was~`you're` speaking ~with~`to` a native speaker who has ~attended~`tens of` thousands of words that ~tension you~`they potentially could` use`,`
many different ways ~are repressed~`of expressing` the same thought `or` responding `to what` you have said,
`if` you ~have~`haven't` got~ten~ good comprehension, you are not ~been~`gonna be in the` conversation very long.
You can struggle to get your ~wrong menu~`own meaning across,` ~when~`but` you ~are close by~`have to have` good comprehension.
`How do you get good comprehension?`
I think `there are` 5 concepts that I have`n't` felt in my own experience have been `very` useful to me.
