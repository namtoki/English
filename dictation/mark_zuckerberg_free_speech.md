It's really grate to be here `at` geoge town ~of~`with all of` you today.
Befere we get started, I just wanna take a moment to acknoledge that ~I~ today we lost ~the~`an` icon `Elijah Cummings`.
He was a powerful voice for equality and for social progress and ~him~`for bringing people` together.

Back when I was in ~a~ college, our coutry `had just gone to` war in ~our lack~`Iraq`.
And `the` mood on our campus was ~disblief~`disbelief`.
~One~`A lot of` people ~from~`felt` like ~Euro~`we were` acting without `hearing` ~one~`a lot` of ~the~ important ~inspectives~`perspectives.`
And ~then~`the toll on` soldiers and `their families and our` national ~society~`psyche` was severe.
~you~`And` most of us ~feel~`felt` like we `were` powerless to do anything about it.

And I remember ~a~ feeling that `if` more people ~have~`had` a voice to share their experiences, ~than~`then` maybe `it could have gone` differently.
And `those early years` shape`d` my belief `that` giving more people ~our~`a` voice gives ~the~ power `to` the powerless and push~the~`es` society to get better over time.

Now back ~analyze~`then I was` just building `an` early version of ~the~ Facebook for my community.
But I got the chance to see my values and `beliefs play out at a` small`er` ~skills~`scale`.

`When students got to` express `who they were and what mattered to them,`
      ^^^^^^^^                                    ^^^^
      glottal                                     wa

they start`ed` more student ~incluve~`groups` ~say,~`they` organize`d` more businesses, and
                                                                                     ^^^^^^
                                                                                     linking

`they` even challeng~ing~`ed` `some established ways of` doing ~than~`things around` campus.

And it ~tell~`taught` me the lesson ~the one of~`that while a lot of the` world often forcuses on the big ~invent~`events and` institutions,
             ^^^^^^^^^^^                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
             strength                                 strength

the bigger story `is that` most progress ~than~`in` our lives actually comes from individuals having ~our~`more of a` voice.
                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                              strength
