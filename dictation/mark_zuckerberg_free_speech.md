It's really grate to be here `at` geoge town ~of~`with all of` you today.
Befere we get started, I just wanna take a moment to acknoledge that ~I~ today we lost ~the~`an` icon `Elijah Cummings`.
He was a powerful voice for equality and for social progress and ~him~`for bringing people` together.

Back when I was in ~a~ college, our coutry `had just gone to` war in ~our lack~`Iraq`.
And `the` mood on our campus was ~disblief~`disbelief`.
~One~`A lot of` people ~from~`felt` like ~Euro~`we were` acting without `hearing` ~one~`a lot` of ~the~ important ~inspectives~`perspectives.`
And ~then~`the toll on` soldiers and `their families and our` national ~society~`psyche` was severe.
~you~`And` most of us ~feel~`felt` like we `were` powerless to do anything about it.
