I love `it when` ~the one~ `a` product~s~ surprises me.
~And~ `I mean` sometime`s` `you` ~she~ `think` ~is thinking~ `you've got it` all figure`d` out.
`But` ~Denon~ `then the` ~model~ `more you` use~s~ `a` product~s~ `you` discover~d~, it's actually `something` quite ~difinitely~`different`.

`The` Marantz slimline series has been ~a~ one of my favorite line`s` of receivers going back years now.
~The~`Their` newest model ~slim~ `the cinema` 70~s~ maybe the brand`s` best ~year~`yet` for ~the~ one very important reason.
Now this 7.2 channel~s~ ~are~`AK` capable ~of~ Dolby Atmos surround `sound` receiver `produces 50 watts per channel into 8 ohms.`
