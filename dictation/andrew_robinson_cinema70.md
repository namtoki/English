I love `it when` ~the one~ `a` product~s~ surprises me.
~And~ `I mean` sometime`s` `you` ~she~ `think` ~is thinking~ `you've got it` all figure`d` out.
`But` ~Denon~ `then the` ~model~ `more you` use~s~ `a` product~s~ `you` discover~d~, it's actually `something` quite ~difinitely~`different`.

`The` Marantz slimline series has been ~a~ one of my favorite line`s` of receivers going back years now.
~The~`Their` newest model ~slim~ `the cinema` 70~s~ maybe the brand`s` best ~year~`yet` for ~the~ one very important reason.
Now this 7.2 channel~s~ ~are~`8K` capable ~of~ Dolby Atmos surround `sound` receiver `produces 50 watts per channel into 8 ohms.`

`And while that` figure is `with` only two channels `driven`, you ~to~`do` get Marantz's 70% guarantee.
meaning `that when` powering `seven` speakers, `users` should experience roughly 35 `watts` ~for a~`per` channel from `its` class `AB` amplifiers.
while that ~meaning that~`may not` sound like a lot for most Everyday Use, you would be amazed `at` how far you can go with 35 watts.

~which~`What's` really great about the 70 is ~in the~`its` preamp outs for all 7 `of its` channels and subwoofer~s~
and it can be put into a ~bit straight~`strict preamp` mode ~factively~`effectively`,
turning ~70-70 8~`the cinema 70 into a` dedicated home ~zero~`theater` process`or` which is absolutely ~cratch~`clutch`
for those ~seed~`who see their` system growing and ~reading and~`needing` more ~time~`power over time`.

In addition to its ~new fun~`Newfound` frexibility, the 70 has 6 HDMI ~and AK~`input three of which are 8K` capable.
The 70 also supports ~so k 20~`4K 120 with` gam~e~`ing` features such as ~VR/AR~`VRR ALLM` `and quick frame` transport all `of` which `it` pass`ed` ~in the~`with flying` colors.
Of course the 70 can also ~upcase~`upscale` ~100p to~`1080p` and ~AK~`4K` `signals all the way up to 8K` via `an` HDMI connection.
