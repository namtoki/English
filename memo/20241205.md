## Demonstration

I'll give a demonstration of that.
give me more 3 minutes.

Now, a PerL Pro is connected with my laptop via USB-C. they've been paired with my iPhone as well.
and
this is the tool that shows audio processing streams in the DSP, which is one of Qualcomm software.
and
As you can see, it shows some audio processing blocks and their connections.

And this scenery varies depending on the situation.
Say you call, like this, and you play music, like this.

The picture I've attached in that confluence page is this. it's hard to see in this state, so I adjust them before attaching it.

## come clean

and details on these blocks are described in some Qualcomm documents. but I'm not sure what they are because they are more like acoustic things.
So I want to leave these things up to our acoustic team. you know what i mean?

But you can kind of understand what role they have from these words, right?

On top of that, you can see debug logs using another Qualcomm tool.
and you can see application processers give commands to these blocks via each API.
That's the way I identified that.

That's it.

i don't know until I look into them more reading some Qualcomm documents or something like that.

I'll `get to it` as soon as I can.

Nothing in particular. thank you.
