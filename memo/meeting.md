### Transparency

Me
> (As I shared last week,)
> it’s just that I'll continue digging into its feasibility by the end of MS3.

Me
> Do you want me to explain it again?
> Sure.

Me
> (In the last meeting,)
> I reported that
>   Airoha doesn’t support transitioning to Transparency Mode via Voice Trigger for now.
>
> So
> I’ll also ask ODM vendors if they can implement it and how to implement it.
>
> and
> Eastech has already confirmed they can,
> and
> (given Airoha’s chip architecture includes a hardware accelerator for voice detection,)
> it should be possible (at the end of the day).
> 
> And
> I’ll keep checking with Airoha on when they might support this,
> Also
> I'm working on getting confirmation from ODM vendors regarding feasibility of it.

### Voice Prompt / TTS

Me
> (If I had to say,)
> who has the ball for deciding which service to use for Voice Prompt?
> 
> (In the meeting,)
> we concluded that the only way to decide on a TTS service is to check with native speakers.
> 
> I don’t think
>   the software team is in a position to take the lead anymore.
> Reaching out to native speakers of different languages in the company and running evaluations
> isn’t really software development anymore, is it?
> 
> I strongly believe the UX team should `take care of` this task.
> Should we create a Jira task for it and assign it to you?

### LE Audio

Me
> So this is a feature where S V when ___ happens, right?
> 
> You talked about this before, right?
> what did we decide at that time?
> Apologies, I didn’t have the opportunity to do the handover from XXXX-san.
> I can't say for sure` without checking, but..

### Transparency

Me
> Should the focus be on natural ambient sound passthrough
>                     or
>                     on making face-to-face conversations easier?
> or
> should multiple modes be provided to accommodate both?

Me
> `I assume` one of them is a typo,
> but
> (in Chapter 4's GIVEN WHEN THEN part,) `it says` 'THEN pause audio,'
> (while in Chapter 5, Section 2,) `it says` 'lower the media volume.'
> Which one is correct?

### Startup

Me
> If the only goal is to speed up login, I don’t think it’s necessary.
