Introduce myself
================

Hi, Name's Toshiyuki.
But I usually go by Toshi. (But my friends call me Toshi.)

Pleasure to meet you.

Japan-born-and-raised.
More specifically, I was born and raised in Nagoya.

Do you know about Nagoya?

It's about like 1 hour and 30 minutes by Shinkansen from Yokohama. it's in the west side from here.
and it is located next to Toyota, you know, which is famous for automobile manufacturer.
So, it's a heavily trafficked city.

Going back to my story,
I'm a big fan of Baystars which is a baseball team in Japanese professional league.
I usually enjoy watching their games.

I work as a software engineer at an audio equipment manufacturer.

Actually, I changed jobs last October.
And it's American owned company. So I have to get to use English.

Um, that's about it.
