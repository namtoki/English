There is little to report from software team today.

The reason being that, as you know, we've just changed focuses from Qualcomm to Airoha.

Say we used one of the Airoha SoCs, we have to select the one, which is suitable to our product.

A meeting with Airoha was held this Monday and they say AB1592 is the potential option.
But I think that these three models can be in our scope because they have almost the same features, but they are different a little bit.
So software team is working on it by reading documents or asking Airoha team unclear points.

    For one thing, they are the latest models, which is said that have reasonable features for our next product.
    
    we'll explain details as soon as we understand them.

my team is gonna proceed with technical feasibility study in the course of IC selection's work at the same time.
the target date is the end of February for the moment.

And the bottom one is the rest task for PCBA with Qualcomm chip.
HW team says that they want to do some tests using PCBA or Prototype, especially a RF capability test.
So I'll release the firmware which is ensured to work for these test for Grandsun.
This is an easy job, I think.
