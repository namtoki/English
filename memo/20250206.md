Hi everyone,
I'll report this week.

The software team is investigating if all requirements can be implemented on the Airoha chips following the steps below.

The very first step, it has been done, but software team has regarded requirements C840 has already implemented as "Feasible"
`This assumes that the functions supported by 77 are also supported by 92.`
`That's how it turns out that almost half of requirements are "Feasible"
and the remaining requirements move on to the next step.`

It just happened to be in this building.
It seems like someone obtained this from Airoha at the launch of the C840 project.
