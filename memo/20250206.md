`I'll report this week.`
`Please give me five minutes or so.`
`and let me share my screen.`

`Can you see me?`

`OK.`

The software team is now investigating if all requirements can be implemented on the Airoha chips one by one following the steps below.

### 1st

`The very first step, it has been already done, but` software team has regarded requirements C840 has already implemented as "Feasible"
    `This logic assumes that the functions supported by 77 are also supported by 92.`
`For example, the requirement number 119, LE Audio Setting is feasible because AH-840 supports this requirement.`
`By this logic,` it turns out that almost half of requirements are "Feasible"
`and the remaining requirements move on to the next step.`

### 2nd

`In the next step,` soft team has regarded requirements Airoha documents or members say feasible as "Feasible"
`software team has studied features deeply by reading documents like this available from the portal site named Airoha Online.`
`And by asking Airoha representatives about unclear points on email.`
`For example, the requirement number 25, Bluetooth Version is feasible because SDK release note says ~~ and Airoha members says the process has been done.`
consequently, turns out that tuns of requirements are feasible.

However, for the requirements related to the following, their HW performance need to be evaluated through actual operation
`These items are almost all feasible but whether these quailities surpass our expectation is whole other thing.`
These items move on to next step.

`They are not big deal, I think.`

### 3rd

`And now we have just started step3`
Evaluation through actual operation with Evaluation Kit or Prototype or competitor products using AB1577/AB1592
    `What I call Evaluation Kit is like ,,,  this.`
    `It just happened to be in this building.`
    `It seems like someone obtained this from Airoha at the launch of the C840 project.`

`The most important thing is that` There is a high possibility that this task will be carried over until MS3-MS5.
`because audio quality things are difficult to evaluate, I think.`

That's it.
