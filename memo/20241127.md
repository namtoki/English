Hi, My name is ~.
I'm a member of Headphone software team which consists of two members, ~san and me.
And two more members are gonna be assigned to our team next spring, so our team will consist of four members at that time.

But to be honest, this is the first time for us all to develop Headphones, QCC chips as well.

So far we are struggling to study of QCC and almost all things are going well except for Bluetooth.

so, All things considered, I would appreciate it if there are members familiar with Bluetooth things in your team.

On top of that, the best is you have some members familiar with QCC itself.

Altough we've not been faced with Bluetooth issues at this point in time,
I'm not surprised if the Bluetooth issues could appear.


Qualcomm SDK has a lot of Bluetooth logs and it shows tons of Bluetooth words in the console.
Such as
it would be nice to realize kind of weird things occurs once you see that logs.
