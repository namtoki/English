# Why Software Engineer is No Longer A Dream Job

`Remember when` working as a software engineer felt like striking gold?

Free meals, extravagant offsites, crazy stock grants, a $2,000 `vacation stipend`.

This is just a small portion of the `perks` offered by some of the biggest tech companies.

In a few short years, a software engineer went from being the rock stars of the job market
to being seen as next on the chopping block about to be replaced by artificial intelligence or cheaper overseas labor.

`Despite` record profits, the layoffs `continue to this day`.

Block based in Oakland laying off 240 remote California employees.
Meta will begin layoffs this week. 5% of its global workforce.
The tech giant has announced it will cut nearly 3% of its workforce.

How did this happen? And where do we go from here?

## FEEL
Whether it was the `lavish perks` or the useful optimism, tech companies just `felt` different from other `soulless` mega corporations.
After the 2008 financial crisis basically turned bankers and finance guys into villains,
tech was took the place of where you could actually earn a great salary while making a positive impact.

Like many of you, I also watched the movie The Social Network and was inspired by the `idea` that
a couple of dropouts who could code created a billion dollar startup without anyone's permission.

A billion dollar valuation.

Back then, it seemed like there was a never-ending demand for engineers,
and everyone and their grandma was told to just learn to code.

Don't just play on your phone, program it.

The education system decided to `sell shovels during this gold rush`.
And from 20 2015 to 2022, CompsAI graduates doubled.

## POPUP
Coding boot camps started `popping up` in every major city.
And the number of coding boot camp grads went from 18K in 2016 to 60K in 2023.

For a really long time, we as software engineers enjoyed the power that we had in the job market.

An ex meta employee `captures` what some of us started to feel at that time.

You felt untouchable.

And maybe it's because of this `pampering` and `talk of` being a family
that I started to subconsciously believe that I was more than just an employee.

## LAID-BACK
## MEANT-THAT
I thought that the fun, `laid-back` environment and wellness benefits `meant that`
## AND-NOT-JUST
they `cared about` us as people `and not just` hit counts on a spreadsheet.

I really `internalized` the company's `grandiose` mission statements
and the idea that I was part of something that would change the world.

I wasn't just building a messaging app.
I was changing the way the world communicates.

When you see your other youthful co-workers as friends and you guys are part of this team working towards this amazing mission,
you don't question working longer hours for lower pay.

And as I'll learn later, this becomes a recipe for exploitation.

The 2021 post-pandemic period marked the start of the latest tech jobs bubble, and it wasn't like anything I've ever seen before.

## STRONGESTEXAMPLE
What I've noticed is that tech companies are `some of the strongest examples of` herd mentality.

When Google does something like hire a ton of people, other tech companies tend to `follow suit`, driving the demand further.

It's like this reinforcing cycle where behavior is contagious.

## NOTHING-MORE-THAN-THE-FACT-THAT
Like tech tech executives will make decisions based on nothing more than the fact that Google's doing it
and you know Google must know what they're doing so we should do it too.

And the hiring `frenzy` became so intense that Meta hired a bunch of people to do absolutely nothing
because they wanted to hoard the talent for themselves.

It's like when there's a ton of hype surrounding a certain product that you don't even necessarily want,
but you buy anyways because you see everyone else doing it.

There wasn't a lot of rhyme or
reason for these decisions and it was
only a matter of time before employees
would have to pay for mistakes that they
didn't make. I was teaching at a coding
boot camp during this time and I
personally witnessed nearly every
student in the co cohort land a job
right before or right after graduating
from a 12-week boot camp. Everyone was
saying learn to code because at that
time it was genuinely good advice.
People were literally doubling their
salaries after a 3-month boot camp. And
you don't get that kind of ROI anywhere
else. myself and everyone I knew in my
network were getting recruiter calls and
emails on a daily basis and everyone was
leaving their current role for a massive
salary bump. But little did we know that
this bubble was about to
burst. 2023 was the worst year for
Silicon Valley since the dotcom crash
with over
260,000 jobs disappearing seemingly
overnight. As pandemic era restrictions
started to lift and people rushed to go
outside again, tech execs suddenly
realized that they had massively
overhired. Pelaton's stock dropped
faster than most people ditched their
New Year's resolutions. Amazon hired at
really elevated levels during the
pandemic era, and they're still learning
that they're having to unwind that level
of hiring because the economy they find
themselves in now has changed. Because
of the high interest rates, companies
and investors were no longer interested
in putting money into moonshot ideas.
They wanted a return on investment and
they wanted it fast. In the division I
worked for, we stopped working on
experimental projects that cost money in
the short term but had the potential to
grow into something big in the future.
We went back to maintaining the legacy
systems, which was boring, but at least
it was a safe revenue generator. And
because the cost of borrowing was so
high, investors wanted a short-term,
surefire return on their investment. And
what's one of the fastest ways to do
that? Mass layoffs. They started in
2023, and as we all know, they're still
happening today. Each layoff made it
easier for the next company to do
layoffs because, hey, everyone else was
doing it. And like I mentioned before,
there is that herd mentality that comes
into play. And while it sucks for the
affected employees, Wall Street
continues to reward them for doing this.
In 2023, Meta stock price shot up
194%, making them the fifth largest tech
company at the same time that they laid
off 21,000
people. It's 2025 and the vibe has
completely shifted. Gone are the days of
extravagant off-site retreats, free
laundry, and flexible work from home
arrangements. They're instead replaced
by the threat of ongoing layoffs, return
to work mandates, and mounting
responsibilities. Among the tech giants,
Apple, Meta, Tik Tok, and Google have
mandated a 3-day return to work policy.
And Amazon has even required their
employees to return to the office
full-time. Netflix and Google are even
cutting back on free company swag, which
kind of surprised me because I didn't
even realize people wanted those things.
But I guess if you're in Silicon Valley,
you have got to fit in somehow. Meta
also cut 5% of its staff earlier this
year and publicly called it a
performance-based layoff in a move that
displayed a shocking lack of empathy.
Not to mention, a lot of the people that
they let go apparently received glowing
performance reviews. Meta not only took
away people's jobs, but also destroyed
their ability to find another one just
so that they could put the blame on
someone else. Google, who you know
understandably is feeling the heat of
the competition from generative AI, is
also putting pressure on their employees
to get back into the office. Sergey
Brin, its founder, even mentioned that a
60-hour week is the sweet spot for
productivity in an internal memo. On top
of all of this, AI is also being shoved
down our throats from executives who
assume they know how to do your job
better than you do. Shopify's CEO, for
example, recently released an internal
memo saying that employees are now
required to use AI as part of their jobs
and their AI use will even be a factor
in their performance reviews. AI tools
are incredible, and I've advocated for
their use in countless times in prior
videos. But I think that making this a
job requirement to me feels like
overreach. It signals that you don't
trust your employees to use their own
judgment and discern when it's
appropriate to use AI and when it's not.
A blanket requirement like this is very
big brother to me. But I'm curious what
you guys think. So, let me know in the
comments down below. If you're being
asked to learn AI skills for your
current role or you're a beginner who's
just curious about what neural networks
are, you should take a look at
Brilliant. I've personally gone through
their course on how LLMs work and
introduction to neural networks when I
wanted to learn AI fundamentals. At
first, I was intimidated by these
seemingly complex topics, but Brilliant
made them easy to understand and
approachable even for beginners. And if
you're not looking to learn AI right
now, no problem. They have a
comprehensive catalog of courses that
will help you build a solid foundation
in math and programming from computer
science fundamentals to introduction to
probability. Brilliant offers
interactive bite-siz lessons that you
can squeeze in during your commute or
while you're on your lunch break. Best
of all, you're not just passively
watching videos, but you're actively
solving problems and building real
understanding. To try everything

Thank you so much, Brilliant, for
sponsoring this video. Only a few short
years ago, tech companies were one of
the first ones to launch these flashy
diversity, equity, and inclusion
initiatives. These companies proudly
announced donations to fight racism and
wrote lengthy newsletters on how they're
going to address injustice, taking
advantage of the positive PR that they
were generating. But recently, companies
including Walmart, Meta, and Google have
all quietly rolled back these programs,
caving into the fear of the current
administration. Whether or not these DEI
programs were effective or necessary are
beyond the scope of this video, but for
me at least, it's sobering to so clearly
see that these programs were driven by
profit and nothing else. Companies not
only didn't really care in the first
place, but they actively chose to
financially and reputationally benefit
from virtue signaling during these
tragedies and injustices.
So what is the future for software
engineers? Is it still a dream job with
a certain aura or has it lost its
prestige and is now just another white
collar job? I think a lot of us, myself
included, have nostalgia for the glory
days of 2021. The tech industry seeing
huge success despite the pandemic. So
the tech field, also known as STEM, is
booming right now and it might be just
what you're looking to pivot into.
There's a hiring pandemic that is the
opposite of what we just lived through
in 2020. There is a lot of power that
comes from knowing if your boss screws
you over, you can just walk down the
street and get a new gig that pays more
than what you're currently making. Now,
we're all getting whiplash from this
shift in power. But you got to remember
that layoffs, deadlines, and working in
the office aren't exactly unique to
software shares. In fact, they're the
norm at every other job. And on top of
that, we're generally paid more as well.
I've worked in the service industry
where your bathroom breaks were timed to
the minute and you couldn't take any
time off during the holidays. And to be
honest, the downsides of working in tech
doesn't really compare. Okay, I realize
I just compared apples to oranges. But
my point is that I think even with all
the perks taken away, we still have it
pretty good as software engineers. For
example, as much as everyone hates leak
code, I just can't think of another
industry where you can just spend 2 to 3
months studying for free by yourself and
have a straight path to essentially
doubling your salary. So, I guess while
a lot of us resent how fast things have
changed in a couple short years, I think
it's important to recognize that the
recent downsides like the layoffs and
the stricter deadlines have been the
normal for most other white collar jobs.
That being said, I think we're all
sobering up to the reality that we are
simply headcount on a balance sheet. At
one point, maybe some of us were deluded
by our own self-importance into
believing that we were part of a family
and that mission statements were more
than empty platitudes. Company
executives will call you family and in
town halls talk about how well the
company is doing, but at the same week
lay off 20% of the staff. I'm not
blaming the individual companies or
especially their executives as I know
that they're simply operating in a
capitalistic society. But in the same
vein, we as employees cannot be blinded
by this false idea of camaraderie or be
compelled to be loyal to a for-profit
entity. Even if they pamper you with
wellness days or free massages, at the
end of the day, they will put their
profits ahead of your wellness. And in
this economy, you kind of have to do the
same. At the end of the day, it's up to
you to set firm boundaries with work and
realize what's important because no one
else is watching out for you. Thank you
so much for watching. If you like this
