# RURI

`Till recently`, I personally didn't even believe in love in our modern age. But I disagree now.

`Often times`, people don't realize how their words affect others.

Let's `get together with` the old college friends this weekend.

Real love, in my opinion, isn't `something you` find. It's `something you` build.
And building `requires` understanding why we keep falling into these patterns `in the first place`.

We`'ve been sold the idea that` love is something magical you `stumble into` like a soulmate who instantly `gets you`.
