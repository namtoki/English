# TODAY

Hello, my name is Toshiyuki Tanamura, and I usually go by Tana `short for` Tanamura.

I've been at this company for about two years.
Before joining here, I was involved in developing storage software, drone software, and a little bit Android applications.

Now I've `been working on` headphone product development, specifically PerL2, which is the successor to PerL1.
I'm a member of the Software Project Management team. We have another member in Shirakawa,
so our team consists of two people including myself.

This is Denon & Marantz's first attempt at developing TWS headphones `in-house`,
so this project is quite challenging for us.

I think there are two key points:

First,
and this isn't software related,
PerL1 has a critical downside: it's too big and heavy.
Our mechanical engineers and designers are `addressing` this,
and PerL2 will be much more compact compared to PerL1.

Second,
this is software-related:
the personalization functionality called AAT in PerL1.
As you know, the AAT technology belongs to the Nura team, which was originally `a separate company`
but merged with us recently.

That team will remain on the Masimo side after the Harman merger `concludes`.

So we need to find an alternative solution or develop one ourselves.
and, we ended up deciding to adopt a third-party vendor solution called Mimi.

These are the two key challenges, I believe.

At the same time,
I see this project as our first step toward developing TWS headphones in-house.
In this project, an ODM vendor will design and implement almost all the software,
but we're planning to have them share the source code with us.
This will allow us to dive deep into the TWS headphone software world.

I'm excited to `get our hands on it soon`."
