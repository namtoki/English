## Federated Login

As for federated login,

while this feature isn't currently supported by the Nura Server (AWS EC2-based),
the Denon Headphone App source code shows some federated login APIs.

I've inquired about feasibility and implementation effort to the server team, but the team hasn't responded yet.

Since they've answered other questions, this may be a particularly complex issue for them.
So, it might require significant development effort from both app and server teams.

## 6 digits

The 6-digit login system is known as a "passwordless method" or "one-time password" (OTP).

To me, in my opinion, this method is perfectly valid.

It's actually becoming popular in the SaaS industry
  —platforms like Slack, Notion, Udemy and etc use OTP authentication.

The main benefit is that users don't need to remember complex passwords.
This isn't an outdated method;
it's actually a current best practice in the first place.

The effort required to switch to a password-based method doesn't justify the benefits at all.
