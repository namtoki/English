Speaking of which,
where are the image files located?
Do you have any detailed design materials
that include like ratio information between widgets or pixel specifications or something like that?

Once we're done, we'll compare them against these Figma designs,
and as long as the differences aren't too major, they should be acceptable.
This is the flow I understand.
