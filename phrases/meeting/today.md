## Communication Tools

Hi, I'm Toshiyuki Tanamura, a software team member on the Harman side.

When it comes to how we manage tasks collaboratively, we'd like to use JIRA on the Harman side, as we did in the C500 and C840 projects.

And if you are familiar with JIRA, you may notice that JIRA is based on some Agile frameworks, like Scrum and Kanban.
That being said, we don't enforce Eastech's work to be a particular Agile framework. This is our core principle.
So to speak, "No Framework Required: Eastech Drives Your Own Process."
In other words, Eastech can feel free to move forward with tasks using your own management style.
This is the core principle.
