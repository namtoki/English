### Question from me
Yeah, yeah.
As for the question I asked this week,
to begin with,

I'd like to know whether Voice Clarity can be enabled during calls — putting aside whether this is useful or not.

Supposing that Voice Clarity is enabled during a call, is there any chance that some user experiences would be improved compared to when Voice Clarity is off? Of course, I understand that the current version of Voice Clarity doesn't denoise incoming signals during decoding. However, even without that feature, Voice Clarity still has Natural Ambience feature: it removes environmental noise around the wearer, and it minimizes self-voice amplification using some algorithm, right?

So I assume that even with just Natural Ambience feature, there would be some effectiveness in terms of call experience.
Does that make sense?

I understand that we can only determine whether there's any effectiveness during phone calls by actually testing it in real use scenarios.

### SoW

I have some comments.
First, as for Sound Personalization,
at Implementation section, I can see the sentence "Note: the hearing test-flow itself can only be themed as described above".
Does this mean that API-based integration cannot provide the same level of functionality/customization?
